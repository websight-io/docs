Last Friday (02.12.2022) we had much pleasure speaking at the ConSelenium conference in Warsaw.


In the presentation, we focused on the steps our product team had evolved through to change the approach to quality. From the time perspective, we see the change turned out to be a revolution. We ended up with the Quality Assistance approach (where we use our quality experts as consultants and mentors) that replaced the standard Quality Assurance role that we used to have before.


Additionally, as a team that builds platforms for delivering Digital Experience, we want the future project based on WebSight to take advantage of our developers' experience and make their start even easier. That’s why starting a new project from our archetype includes fully integrated units and end-to-end (functional + visual) tests. But that’s not the end - we will be extending the template in the future to give the dev team even more ready-to-use quality patterns and techniques (e.g. such as CI configuration or automated performance checks as a part of CI).

Thanks again, and stay tuned!
