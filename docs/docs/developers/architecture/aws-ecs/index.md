# Amazon ECS WebSight Architecture
The container services available on AWS make it easy to manage WebSight CMS infrastructure and containers. For container orchestration, you can choose between **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** and **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**. For infrastructure provisioning, you can use **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**, which provides full control over the compute environment, or **Fargate**, a serverless compute option in which the infrastructure provisioning is managed by AWS.

## Physical architecture with Elastic Container Service
This document describes WebSight deployment with **Amazon ECS** and **Fargate**. These are the key principles for this tooling:

- There is no additional charge for the Amazon ECS cluster; you pay only for AWS resources that you create to store and run the application
- ECS uses simple concepts (`services`, `tasks` and `containers`), similar to those in Docker Compose, which enables [Docker ECS integration](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/)
- The developer experience is almost the same localy and in the cloud
- ECS integrates natively with AWS services like `CloudTrail`, `CloudWatch`, `Elastic Container Registry`, and `Elastic File System`
- With Fargate, developers do not have to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This enables a serverless experience, and you pay only for the vCPU and memory resources that your application requests

The following diagram presents the physical architecture of the WebSight CMS environment in AWS.

### Amazon Elastic Container Service
Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service. It uses such abstractions as `services`, `tasks`, `task definitions`, `containers`. In brief, these mean the following:

- Tasks are configured with task definitions and are used to launch containers
- Services guarantee that the required number of tasks are runnning

Each service (`nginx`, `cms`, `mongo`) runs a single task that launches a single container.

### Amazon Elastic File System
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a fully managed, serverless file system with native AWS ECS integration. WebSight uses EFSs to store published experiences, content and logs. Read more details about EFS [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html).

### Amazon Application Load Balancer
Application Load Balancer handles all request from both site visitors (HTTPS on port `443`) and authors (HTTPS on port `8443`), and forwards them to `nginx` or `cms` ECS services. ALB also terminates HTTPS; all routing between ALB and ECS uses HTTP (`80` / `8080`) because the connection is private.
