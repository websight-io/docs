# Howlite

**Howlite** is a sample component library for WebSight. We used this collection to prepare a demo site called Luna. Our WebSight Docker distribution contains both of them. Check the [Getting Started](/docs/docs/quick-start/index.md) page for information on how to run a local instance to explore more on Howlite and Luna.
