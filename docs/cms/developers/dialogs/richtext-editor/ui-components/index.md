  "plugin": ... 
}
```

Where:

-   `type` - should point script with UI component definition
    
-   `configuration` - contains propeties required by component to render properly
    
-   `children` - contains list of subcomponents. It is used by components grouping another ones in some structure.

-   `state` - current state gets from plugin `getState` method
    
-   `action` - action run on event executed by component. Itâ€™s get from plugin `getAction` method
    
-   `children` - children components.
    

```js
const Component = ({ configuration, state, action, children }) => {
  return (
      <></>
  ) 
}
```
