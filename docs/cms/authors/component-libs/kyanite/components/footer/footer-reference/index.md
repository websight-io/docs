# Footer reference

_Since_: 0.0.2

Footer reference allows authors to use Footer content from Homepage at any page within the same space.
It works as an <a href="../../fragment">Experience fragment</a>, with Homepage Footer serving as a reference.
For usual fragment you would create an Experience Fragment page and publish it separately,
but Footer reference content is published along with Homepage.

Since v.0.4.21 you don't need to republish the page after Footer content has changed.
You publish the Homepage and Footer reference is automatically updated on every published page.
The only limit is you must create Homepage first, otherwise there is nothing to refer to.

## Usage

Please follow te <a href="../../navbar/navbar-reference#usage">Navbar reference guide</a> 
as it works exactly the same as Footer reference - just read 'Navbar' as 'Footer'.

## Authorable properties

Footer reference doesn't have authorable properties.
