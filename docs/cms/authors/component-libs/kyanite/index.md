# Kyanite

Kyanite is a sample component library for the [WebSight CMS](https://www.websight.io/) based on [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).
It contains components similar to ones from Bulma with small style/features adjustments as well as
brand new components created to improve authoring experience with WebSight and Kyanite.

This documentation corresponds to version **0.4.19** of Kyanite.

Kyanite components are currently split on two groups, going under separate packages:
* common - basic components and page templates
* blogs - components and page templates serving for easy creation of blog articles and managing information about blog authors
