# Kyanite

Kyanite is a sample component library for the [WebSight CMS](https://www.websight.io/) based on [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).
It contains components similar to ones from Bulma with small style/features adjustments as well as
brand new components created to improve authoring experience with WebSight and Kyanite.

The Kyanite library currently consists of two groups of components:

* [Common](./common) - basic components and page templates
* [Blogs](./blogs) - built upon Commons, 
includes components and page templates serving for easy creation of blog articles

[//]: # (TODO think over division into layouts/non-layouts, because 'Kyanite layouts' are not actually layouts in the UI)
[//]: # (TODO should columns be in a separate 'Kyanite Columns' group?)
[//]: # (TODO should featuredblogarticle be in 'Kyanite Components' group?)
[//]: # (TODO fix links in sections' component lists)
