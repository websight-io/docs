# Cards List & Card Item

The Cards List component can be used to arrange multiple card components on a page. If you have 20 cards, you may want to display them in a grid with 4 items or 5 items per row or as a slider with 4 or 5 cards per slide. A Cards List component makes it easy to quickly switch between different layouts.

Cards may contain an image, text and a CTA.

## Usage

Drag & drop the Card List component to a Page section. Cards List is prefilled with 3 initial Card Items. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img class="image--with-border" src="./cards.jpg" alt="Cards List">
</p>

You can drag & drop additional Card Item to the Card List component, or delete unneeded Card Items.
