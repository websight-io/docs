# Accordion & Accordion Item

An Accordion is an interactive component that can have multiple Accordion Items inside. Each Accordion Item is 'collapsed' by default, and only a title is visible. To open the accordion item, switch editor to the "Preview" mode and click on heading.

## Usage

Drag & drop Accordion to a Page Section. Accordion will be prefilled with 3 initial Accordion Items. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img class="image--with-border" src="./accordion.jpg" alt="Accordion">
</p>

You can drag & drop additional Accordion Item to Accordion component, or delete unneeded items. You can also move Accordion Items up/down to achieve expected items order.
