# Layouts

**Layouts** are group of components with predefined properties. They are used to define a specific page layout. They can be drag & dropped on a page instead of single components to speed up authoring process.

## Usage

To try it out open a blank page, select a Layouts tab in the left-side panel and drag and drop a 3 columns layout to the main page content. A page section with 3 resized containers will be added on a page.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img class="image--with-border" src="./layouts-tab.jpg" alt="Layouts Tab">
</p>

All components that are added on a page with a given layout can be modified, moved or removed (same as regular components).

## Type of Layouts in Howlite

 There are two groups of layouts in Howlite:

- **Empty Sections** - used to define 1-4 empty columns (containers within a page section):
- **Filled Sections** - more complex page sections with some content inside, for example:
    - **Call To Action** (a page section with full-width image, title and CTAs)

     <p align="center" width="100%">
        <img class="image--with-border" src="./call-to-action.jpg" alt="Call To Action" width="600px">
    </p>

    - **Hero** (a page section with a title, an image and a mouse icon at the bottom; used at the top of a page)

    <p align="center" width="100%">
        <img class="image--with-border" src="./hero.jpg" alt="Hero" width="600px">
    </p>

     - **Full Width Image** (a page section with a full-width image, a title on the left, and text on the right side)

     <p align="center" width="100%">
        <img class="image--with-border" src="./full-width-image.jpg" alt="Call To Action" width="600px">
    </p>

    - **Image Left** (a page section with an image on the left, and text on the right side)

     <p align="center" width="100%">
        <img class="image--with-border" src="./image-left.jpg" alt="Call To Action" width="600px">
    </p>

    - **Image Right** (a page section with an image on the right, and text on the left side)

     <p align="center" width="100%">
        <img class="image--with-border" src="./image-right.jpg" alt="Call To Action" width="600px">
    </p>
