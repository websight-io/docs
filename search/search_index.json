Defining quality, agreeing on KPIs and planning subsequent steps is a thing. So is having an efficient QA process that helps to achieve it (not block the team from reaching their goals nor demotivate them). It is even more demanding to make the whole development team really care about the quality and make each member feel responsible for it when we move from quality assurance to quality assistance and want to share some of typical QA duties between each team member. So is it possible to have the whole team (not a single quality hero) that ensures the manufactured product meets requirements and keeps guard over quality standards? How and when we do it in our project? How we care about the quality We want to create a new and cutting-edge product. That\u2019s something we strongly believe in but apart from the final effect that, we hope, will positively struck our clients, it is also a kind of innovative approach to our every day work. How we do this? Once we agreed on the main purpose of the product (what it should do and how) we also started our discussion about what the quality means to us and how we are going to make sure that we build a high quality product. Next step was to start creating a QA plan and QA process that would evolve and adapt in time but would also help us to take care about quality from the very beginning. Putting there main ideas like the definition of the quality, and what we should do and how we should work to be able to say that our product meets quality requirements was our main objective here but apart from it we also needed to think how to engage everyone from the team in the process to let this really happen. Working on definition at the same time having quality in the back of our mind was the first step to do at this stage but we wanted to do more. Apart from delivering units and integration, code-reviews and cross-testing (which we actually try to facilitate by experimenting with extreme programming techniques like pair-programming and making the whole process continuous), we decided to create a suite of automated functional checks with Cypress.io that we could make use of to regression test our product at various stages. So we have started with applying it to check each PR. Thanks to the architecture approach that we have adopted, we work with small, separate limited liability modules, which allows for thorough tests in isolation - in other words, a single PR can be deployed to a dedicated environment where it can be tested first. As a result we don't need to run full regression tests against everything we release each time, which in turn accelerates our software development lifecycle. What is more, we can use automated functional checks when launching a new environment and/or as a nightly regression suite against the latest version of the application. Well, it is still worth mentioning that it is a part of our pipeline to automatically, efficiently and reliably build and deploy code. Here what we mean by saying \u2018reliably\u2019 is that whenever a given release causes any failures it is rejected until any discovered issue has been analyzed and resolved. So we not only think about the future and do our best to plan quality around it but we are also reactive and address issues we come across in our everyday work. This suite of automated checks is also a part of the code we are going to share with our clients and community allowing them to quickly check if their deployments were successful and/or the product still works once they expanded it by adding new features or components. When we start to care about quality Let\u2019s get back to our definition for a while. That is the moment we, apart from focusing on strictly business requirements, plan other activities, including automated checks. Referring to our still evolving DoR (Definition of Ready) and DoD (Definition of Done) where we have added automated functional checks as a part of requirements we hold each team member working on a given feature responsible for creating automated checks that will allow us to regression test this feature later on, according to our processes. As a result we do not need a dedicated role of a quality assurance engineer nor automation engineer that would be responsible for creating and maintaining automated checks. We invest some effort at the beginning but it always pays back, as having automated checks automatically running as a part of the CI process allows us to ultimately save much time needed to re-check feature by feature later. Summary Quality assurance should be a high priority when we think of building a successful product. Building an effective process around it helps much when it starts from the very beginning and lasts until its end. However, delivering quality is a healthy procedure only when there is the whole development team engaged in it, not a single role. And of course, it is always more effective when an implemented, tested and deployed feature can be checked automatically within a few seconds as a part of the CI process instead of struggling to find a person and time for reproducing repeatable regression test cases again and again.","title":"Achieving quality with no dedicated QA Engineers"},{"location":"blog/2022/achieving-quality-with-no-dedicated-qa-engineers/#how-we-care-about-the-quality","text":"We want to create a new and cutting-edge product.

Some developers would say 'Yes' and their solutions would work... sometimes. I've decided to write a post about it because I often see people misunderstand Sling abstraction in relation to JCR. WebSight Resource Browser with non-JCR Resources on WebSight Community Edition When I started to learn AEM more than 10 years ago, my favorite tool was CRXDE. I used it together with a web browser to observe how changes made in a repository affect the resource tree and the site. Once you are familiar with CRXDE, you can start using Maven and a content-package plugin to produce FileVault packages which can be installed on AEM. Such packages may contain code, configurations, users, permissions, and content. Once a package is installed, you can view it in the resource tree. Changes can be previewed in a web browser by entering a resource path with an extension (a default Sling GET servlet offers JSON, text, and XML renderers mapped to .json, .txt, and .xml extensions respectively). So what seems to be the problem here? From my experience, the main issue is the lack of visibility of resources other than JCR in the standard AEM tooling. You've probably heard the golden rule of the Sling community - \"Everything is a Resource\" a million times. The visible resources are sites, pages, assets, users, components, configurations, and bundles... and all are in JCR. Hence it is natural to conclude that a Sling Resource is a JCR Node, well it is a wrong conclusion. At Dynamic Solutions, we work on a generic Sling Resource Browser as a part of WebSight Community Edition (formerly part of WebSight.Admin tools suite). Apart from the support for reading/writing the JCR Resources, it allows users to browse ALL registered resources. Sling comes with 3, WebSight with 4 and AEM with 9 Out Of the Box Resource Providers. For the purpose of this blog post, I've installed WebSight Resource Browser on AEM 6.5 to demonstrate available providers. Note that we don't maintain AEM compatible distribution of WebSight.Admin tools anymore. Sites, pages, DAM, data, users, components, configurations, and bundles come from JCR, but there are others like servlets, scripts, Bundle Resources, File Resources, and Cloud Resources we should know about. JCR is considered to be the most important resource provider. However, in theory, it's possible to run and work on Sling without JCR at all, simply by using other available resource providers. Resources come in a variety of 'shapes and forms', some resource types are read-only, some allow writing data and some allow creating nodes. Our WebSight Resource Browser supports all resource types with a special extension to enable provider-specific features (therefore with full JCR support). OK, so how do I work with resources? First of all, start using them. Whenever you need to integrate Sling with an external system or need to access a custom resource, implementing your own resource provider may be a proper approach. Furthermore, there already exist implementations of some custom resource providers: NoSQL Resource Providers Filesystem Resource Provider Using extended/custom resource providers is definitely the most elegant way of working with resources in a \"Sling way\" (once again - Everything is a Resource). Secondly, it's important to follow certain rules during our day-to-day work: Use Sling Resource API instead of the JCR API, always when possible. The entire hierarchy would be: CMS API > Sling API > JCR API > OAK API, however, it is a subject for a separate post. Encapsulate usage of the JCR API by creating OSGi services and keep them separated from the generic Sling-based code. Use the JCR API only if you need to access JCR-specific features, Sling does not abstract, for example, User Management, Version Management, Permission Management, complex Nodes definitions, FileVault, and indices are only available when using JCR or Oak API. Think of the entire pool of resources, not only ones based on JCR. Remember that resource.adaptTo(Node.class) may simply not work. Summary This blog post is about Sling, but the topics raised here are very important while developing and working with other Sling-based platforms like WebSight, AEM, or Peregrine. This is a preface for further evaluation of an \u201cEverything is a Resource\u201d statement. Is it still valid in 2022?

However, the city is not something permanent. It is constantly changing within its borders. City planners should replan internal city roads easily, adapting them to new requirements. However, for provincial and municipal roads, all changes should be approved by the provincial executive planners. The same rules are valid in IT. As long as we change our private functions, the impact on the overall system is low. However, by changing module interfaces, we can break other modules. We expect a mechanism to define and constantly validate our national, provincial, city and private application roads. In this article, you will learn how we can benefit from OSGi modularity and Sling Feature Model. OSGi Bundles Components are the main building blocks for OSGi applications. With single annotation, we can make a POJO an OSGi component and let the OSGi manage its lifecycle. However, if we want to reference it within our application, we need to declare it as a service . The OSGI implements a service component model - a declarative model for publishing, finding and binding services. This model assumes that all services can expose their functionalities to others. A service implements some API and registers itself in the OSGi service registry. This way, other services can reference other services via APIs, allowing a more dynamic binding. It is how logically we compose the application from small building blocks. On the other hand, we need to group our services into more granular modules, called bundles. A bundle is an identifiable module containing such details as requirements and capabilities - so we initially declare what we need and offer from/to the other registered OSGi bundles. Instead of saying that services communicate with other services, we can say that bundles communicate and collaborate using services. It means that the client of a service is always a bundle. A bundle may register/use zero or more services. While services are the main building blocks for OSGi applications, bundles are the main deployment blocks. With services, we can define loosely coupled objects. With bundles, we organize them into modules with an independent development lifecycle. There are obvious benefits of decomposing an application into modules. A good modularization optimizes the impact of expected changes to only a low percentage of the modules. Cohesive modules containing limited sizes are easy to understand and clearly minimize communication between development teams, thus reducing errors. So It is natural for experienced developers to split their code into smaller pieces with well-defined contracts. 7\u00b12 things However, keeping things small comes with a price - with high granularity, we lose the capability of understanding high-level functionalities. This problem is described in Miller's law , known as 7\u00b12 \u2018things\u2019 . It simply says that we humans have limited cognition and our brains can recall only a few \u2018things\u2019 immediately. That is, up to about 3 or 4 \u2018things\u2019 do not require counting. Over the 7\u00b12 limit, we need to chunk . Miller's law says: Chunking is used by the brain's short-term memory as a method for keeping groups of information accessible for easy recall. Our brain is chunking things based on some common characteristics such as a shape or color. In development, chunking appears at the very low level. Objects and packages are higher-level concepts that group underlying code. Packages are organized into modules (bundles). And having in mind such principles as single-responsibility, we try to keep the number of objects per package small, the same with packages per module. With such a definition, we can easily notice that both modularity and chunking should always be applied together, at every abstraction level. Focusing only on modularity can increase the system complexity drastically. Having that in mind there is an open question: how can we apply chunking at the bundles level. Would it be possible to group bundles into higher level \u2018things\u2019, and then once again group these higher level things into more generic ones, and so on? This is exactly what Sling OSGi Feature Model provides. Sling feature model The feature model is an identifiable JSON-based definition containing bundles, OSGi framework properties and configurations. With these, we can easily define more granular functionalities. What is more, features can be declared from scratch or they can use another pre-existing feature as a prototype . It is especially useful to make minor adjustments to an existing feature and use the new feature instead of the original one. For example, we can replace a single bundle or add a bundle with, for example, testing data However, the Sling OSGI Feature Model is more than the declaration. It also supplies a maven plugin with features validation and aggregation capabilities. The tool that checks all features for completeness and correctness is named the Feature Model Analyser . We can ensure that our declared feature model contains all required bundles during the compilation stage. Once we deliver a feature, we can trust that there are no missing imports (requirements) and that all feature bundles are active. However, there is also a tradeoff - a feature model is declared in advance, so a list of bundles must be complete and final . Example It is time for a short example. Our WebSight CMS is composed of features such as a page editor, package and resource managers, groovy console, assets management etc. In some cases, we want to be able to aggregate some features into the bigger one. The admin tools feature is a good example: It aggregates package manager, resource manager and groovy console. This newly defined feature can be easily used by other teams building more custom applications for our clients. While our development team can deliver a new functionality in the page editor feature without worrying about other admin tools, our CI can check either more high level features for correctness and completeness. Higher-level features work like contracts for more granular features. It is the real benefit of chunking. With the above approach, aggregating higher and higher features, we finally declare the top-level feature as an application-level feature . We keep two base WebSight features: one with local filesystem storage and the second with MongoDB. They differ only in the kind of storage. Finally, we see the feature model as a perfect solution for customization. We keep a separate team delivering a demo website with custom components, styling and templates, called Howlite. This team is reusing the application-level WebSight feature and adding only a single Howlite feature. It is the way we want our clients to work with WebSight. Summary In this article, we presented the idea of features - higher-level blocks of functionalities that build modern OSGi applications. WebSight is composed of multiple features, such as a page editor, assets management, and admin tools. In addition, we are using features aggregation as a starting point for building a client-specific application on top of WebSight. And the last thing to add is that developers can still focus only on small single-purpose building blocks - bundles. Features are nothing but groups of bundles and configs with a higher-level purpose and name.","title":"Building OSGi applications with Sling Feature Model"},{"location":"blog/2022/building-osgi-apps-with-sling-feature-model/#osgi-bundles","text":"Components are the main building blocks for OSGi applications.

CMS CMS stands for Content Management System. The content (titles/paragraphs/labels, but sometimes also assets like images, PDFs, etc.) is the first citizen in CMS. In short words, the application enables content authors to manage (add, update, delete, and finally publish) the content that is later served to the end users by the channel of their choice (e.g., website, mobile app, smart TV). In the previous blog on containerizing the OSGi application , I focused mainly on the system architecture qualities. Today, we will look at the WebSight CMS in the aspect of the working environment (e.g., development, test, acceptance, production) that consists of three separate layers. WebSight CMS is built on top of Apache Sling. As we already noted in the post on understanding Sling Resources , in the Sling world - everything is a resource , including apps, configs, and data. Deploying and scaling the Apache Sling app in the cloud is possible using the Oak Composite NodeStore . However, we decided to take a different approach and implement a custom Bundle Resource Provider . But that\u2019s a topic for a dedicated blog. Now, let\u2019s consider the configuration, application, and data in WebSight CMS. Configuration There are two types of configuration: Application configuration defines the foundation and does not vary between environments (e.g., which modules application starts). Environment configuration is everything likely to vary between environments (including confidential data like passwords or API tokens). In this article, we will focus on the latter. There are multiple practices to provide environment-specific configuration to the application, naming a few: environment variables (language- and OS-agnostic standard), secrets (used in Docker or Kubernetes), files (e.g., attached via Kubernetes ConfigMaps ). Some advantages of using environment configurations independent of the application: The team can change settings without the need to release (or sometimes even without restarting) the application (e.g., thanks to OSGi configuration watching). When we were containerizing the WebSight CMS (which runs on the Apache Sling), we found Felix-dev Interpolation Plugin very handy. Vulnerable configs access is limited to administrators, who set it as secrets in CI or Secrets Manager (e.g., AWS Secret Manager or HashiCorp Vault) and securely mount it to the environment. Application The application (created from the codebase) represents the logic with all necessary add-ons (like models, connectivity with database, or network requests) that delivers business value. In the case of WebSight CMS, we decided to build a stateless application. We keep the data outside the application (e.g., in DB or other persistent forms). That approach enabled the team to gain the following benefits: The application can be destroyed and recreated on demand (in seconds). Horizontal scaling up and down is easy to achieve, thanks to containers. Data The data in CMS (and probably on any other system) is the most precious resource. It is usually not possible to recreate it easily. That is why we treat it in different ways than application or configuration. And the separation enables us to do so. Data could be regularly backed up (depending on desired Recovery Point Objective - RPO) and restored in case of trouble. The time to provide the operational environment ( Recovery Time Objective - RTO) depends on the volume of data because the application and configuration are ready almost instantly after the infrastructure is ready (which is also very fast in the case of cloud providers). Another benefit of data separation is the ability to use different data sets during development and testing. That means we could easily create the application (build an image), test it against corner cases, and later attach it to the production data. The same is true for the opposite direction. The team can easily import the production data into the developer environment to investigate and fix encountered problems. Summary In this blog, we focused on WebSight CMS in the aspect of three separate ingredients that, together with underlying infrastructure, compose a fully working environment. Separation of the configuration, application, and data enables development teams to: Create reusable releases and independent deployment cycles - build an application once, and deploy anywhere, anytime. Gain high confidence in the released application (image tested once, deployed everywhere will be the same). Achieve a high level of security (vulnerable data stored as secrets). Benefit from continuous integration - dedicated content (data) to test edge cases on the same image that travels to the higher environments (acceptance, production). Scale up and down the application (business logic) in an easy and automated way. Improve disaster recovery by optimizing RPO and RTO metrics.

You can achieve the goal with page templates and components. They implement a structure that authors have to follow. However, a total lack of flexibility would require a lot of development effort to cover every case presented in designs. Rich Text Editor (RTE) can be a sweet spot. It is an input field that provides a rich editing experience and offers extra formatting options like bold, italic, or bullet points. Moreover, RTE can deliver additional functionalities for edited content, for example, link definition, undo/redo. Finally, you can customize and extend RTE to provide the desired level of flexibility. This article presents how to use and configure RTE in WebSight CMS. WebSight RTE formatting functionalities WebSight Rich Text Editor provides multiple content editing functionalities with possibilities to adjust and extend them. Each functionality requires a definition of two elements: UI component added to the menu bar; a plugin component that implements various styling or content processing feature. The above separation enables adjustment of the RTE toolbar according to the desired level of freedom. You can configure the editing options as separate buttons, group them in a dropdown or prepare a dropdown list. Moreover, you can extend the set of existing functionalities and create additional UI components or implement different plugins. Then, you can mix them all and include them in the toolbar to provide new options. WebSight CMS delivers the following UI components for the RTE toolbar: Button with a caption or displayed as an icon (if provided); Button Dropdown that groups several buttons in a dropdown; Dropdown that contains a list of options; Link that opens a dialog for a link setup. The list of available plugin components is as follows: Bold Italic Underline Strikethrough Bullet list Ordered list Paragraph Heading Link Unset link Clear formatting Hard Break Text Align Undo Redo Using RTE as a dialog field RTE is not a stand-alone content editor in WebSight CMS. You need to add it in a dialog definition for a component. Use wcm/dialogs/components/richtext as the resource type. Once completed, you can drag and drop the component on a page, open its dialog and enter the content. /libs/howlite/components/richtext/dialog/.content.json ... \"text\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext\" , \"name\" : \"text\" , \"label\" : \"Text\" } ... RTE defined above uses a default configuration. See the regular options available in the toolbar on the image below. It presents an application in the Rich text editor component that is a part of the Howlite library. Components development See our component development guide and documentation for dialogs to learn more on how to use input fields and define dialogs for components. RTE customization Configuration of components You can modify RTE by defining a custom configuration. Thus, let's review its structure first. RTE configuration should include entries for all functionalities available in the editor. Each entry consists of UI component details, and the plugin runs when a user clicks the UI component. See a sample configuration for Bold functionality below: { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Bold\" , \"icon\" : \"format_bold\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/bold\" } } The configuration contains a path to UI Component , its title and icon, and a path to plugin component See the result on the screen presented below. You may need to group buttons in a dropdown, for example, text alignment options. Let's assume the expected result is as follows. You can use the following configuration to implement it. { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/buttondropdown\" , \"title\" : \"Text Alignment\" , \"left\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Left Align\" , \"icon\" : \"format_align_left\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/textalign\" , \"alignment\" : \"left\" } }, \"center\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Center Align\" , \"icon\" : \"format_align_center\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/textalign\" , \"alignment\" : \"center\" } }, \"right\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Right Align\" , \"icon\" : \"format_align_right\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/textalign\" , \"alignment\" : \"right\" } }, \"justify\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Justify Align\" , \"icon\" : \"format_align_justify\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/textalign\" , \"alignment\" : \"justify\" } } } The above scenario requires embedding button components in buttondropdown . Moreover, textalign plugin requires alignment type as a parameter. Sample configuration file It is required to define a proper resource type for the RTE configuration. It should be wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/configuration . Additionally, the configuration should contain definitions for all components as described above. /apps/myapp/components/rte/configuration { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/configuration\" , \"bold\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Bold\" , \"icon\" : \"format_bold\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/bold\" } }, \"italic\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Italic\" , \"icon\" : \"format_italic\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/italic\" } }, \"underline\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Underline\" , \"icon\" : \"format_underlined\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/underline\" } }, \"strikethrough\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Strikethrough\" , \"icon\" : \"format_strikethrough\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/strikethrough\" } } } The above configuration includes just four simple font styles. Its application results in the following RTE. Using custom configuration You can change the RTE configuration in two ways. Firstly, by adding a property with a path to a custom configuration. \"content\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext\" , \"name\" : \"content\" , \"label\" : \"Content\" , \"configuration\" : \"/apps/myapp/components/rte/configuration\" } Another option is to define the configuration explicitly under the field definition. \"content\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext\" , \"name\" : \"content\" , \"label\" : \"Content\" , \"configuration\" : { ... } } Summary Page templates may determine the overall layout of components. However, one of them can be RTE. It gives users some flexibility in the content authoring for a given area on the page. We presented how to adjust the flexibility level granted to authors. You can use a collection of plugins to customize the functionalities of RTE. Moreover, you can implement your UI or plugin components as well. We will cover this advanced topic in one of my next blog posts.

And of course the line can vary from one definition to another. In this blogpost, I would like to look into how the web has changed from web 1.0 to what it is right now and how these changes and business needs have impacted the evolution of content management systems. The evolution of WWW and its impact on content management systems The first website in history was published on August the 6th, 1991 by Tim Berners Lee. While working at CERN, Berners Lee was frustrated with the fact that there is so much knowledge spread with the thousands of researchers employed at CERN and yet\u2026 it is near impossible to access and use it. In his own words: \u201cI found myself answering the same questions asked frequently of me by different people. It would be so much easier if everyone could just read my database.\u201d It took some serious work and negotiations from the London-born physicist to convince his boss to allow him to work on the project then called \u201cInformation Management\u201d (later changed to WorldWideWeb). The website below is the key milestone of that project: The first webpage ( source ) This simple compilation of links and text started everything. Fast forward about 5 - 6 years and the WWW grew to over 200.000 websites . Nothing compared to near 2 billion we have in 2022 1 . But what was noticed then, is that producing new content with HTML authoring tools will simply not scale up to the needs. Wise observation for the time, considering that the websites of tech giants like Microsoft or IBM still looked something like this: Microsoft \u201cwrite us\u201d page in late 1996 ( source ) IBM homepage in October 1996 ( source ) All this was still in the mid of web 1.0 era, Internet Explorer had just learned to support CSS and shortly after Document Object Model was born. Pages like above shaped the early requirements of the CMS: Having one, central repository where content authors would collaborate efficiently; Easing the process of content creation by removing pure HTML creation. More consistency between pages needed; Rudimentary set of permissions for content authors, so that it is clear who can work on which parts of the website; Some basic security over our content and the information we want and potentially do not want to publish. That was really it. And early content management systems allowed for exactly that. Server side scripting transformed simple templates filled in by authors to HTML. One database stored all the content and managed permissions. Only one distribution channel - the desktop, only static pages served, and finally, only one way communication: from the content authors to the web. Things were simple. Fast forward to the Web 2.0 era. This is when users started generating content. Pages were no longer static, e-commerce had arrived and soon social media started becoming very relevant . The web users now communicate with the businesses in digital. And they expect to be heard. Around that time (2008 - 2010) your CMS should: Support WYSIWYG content authoring; Support complex, publishing workflows; Allow for bi-directional communication with your users; Store and serve various media types, including rich media. Things became much trickier - your CMS then had to support some complex processes and integrate with a lot of different applications (think about all the Wordpress app-like plugins). And this is something it was not designed to do initially. One more jump in time and we are in 2015 - 2017. 2017 was the first year when mobile traffic overtook the desktop . And it has remained so until now. The WWW users now expect a consistent experience between desktop and mobile. There are 1 billion websites in the world. Your CMS has become more of a platform that: Supports all devices; Gathers data and customer intelligence; Is context aware and serves personalized content; Supports multiple infrastructure and deployment models; Integrates seamlessly with 3rd party software. Even though monolithic CMS are still standing strong, it is becoming apparent that at some point, the amount of data, touchpoints and users will become a challenge. Scaling monoliths will be complicated or costly but most likely both. And this is actually how we enter the DXP. DXP - a revolution or \u201cjust\u201d next step? I do not like definitions, so I will not quote Gartner Glossary here. Allow me to list the challenges I think a DXP should address: The ability to deliver contextualized experiences to digital channels (web, mobile, apps, social media, email, IoT devices\u2026) and scale up quickly and at low cost . Consistency between all channels and devices for a full, end to end customer journey. There is nothing more annoying than an empty basket on your mobile app when you've just completed it on a website. One to one personalization. 75% of consumers are likely to buy from companies that are able to suggest a product based on their previous interest, buys and journeys 2 . The ability to extend your customer\u2019s profile by easily connecting other systems - CRM, CDP and similar. Using any tools you like. Due to the architecture of a DXP, you should not be subject to vendor - locking. Instead you are able to build the best digital marketing suite out of the tools and systems you feel are best. You could argue that some of the same issues we were trying to solve as early as in 2016. And I would agree. There is a major factor to consider here though, which is the volume . There is a fantastic book by Vaclav Smil called Numbers don\u2019t lie (I\u2019d recommend you give the entire book a read) and one of the chapters touches on the volume of data we produce. Some facts: In 2018 in the United States, the internet users have downloaded 97000 hours of movies and series from Netflix every minute . They watched 4.5 million Youtube movies and generally transferred a total of 3.1 petabytes of data (that is 3.1 x 10 15 bytes). Again that is every minute . In 2016, the pace in which we produced data was estimated to be 16 zettabytes a year, which is 16 * 10 21 bytes. To put that into perspective: you would have to download the 4k Braveheart movie about 400.000.000.000 times to generate the same volume. It is estimated that by 2025 this number will be ten times higher - 160 zettabytes a year (which is 160 * 10 21 bytes). Somewhere in all of this, is your digital estate and your CMS. So what is a DXP? In essence, a DXP is a technological suite, at heart of which could be the CMS.

What is the difference? Should you care?"},{"location":"blog/2022/how-has-cms-evolved-into-dxp/#the-evolution-of-www-and-its-impact-on-content-management-systems","text":"The first website in history was published on August the 6th, 1991 by Tim Berners Lee. While working at CERN, Berners Lee was frustrated with the fact that there is so much knowledge spread with the thousands of researchers employed at CERN and yet\u2026 it is near impossible to access and use it. In his own words: \u201cI found myself answering the same questions asked frequently of me by different people. It would be so much easier if everyone could just read my database.\u201d It took some serious work and negotiations from the London-born physicist to convince his boss to allow him to work on the project then called \u201cInformation Management\u201d (later changed to WorldWideWeb). The website below is the key milestone of that project: The first webpage ( source ) This simple compilation of links and text started everything. Fast forward about 5 - 6 years and the WWW grew to over 200.000 websites . Nothing compared to near 2 billion we have in 2022 1 . But what was noticed then, is that producing new content with HTML authoring tools will simply not scale up to the needs. Wise observation for the time, considering that the websites of tech giants like Microsoft or IBM still looked something like this: Microsoft \u201cwrite us\u201d page in late 1996 ( source ) IBM homepage in October 1996 ( source ) All this was still in the mid of web 1.0 era, Internet Explorer had just learned to support CSS and shortly after Document Object Model was born. Pages like above shaped the early requirements of the CMS: Having one, central repository where content authors would collaborate efficiently; Easing the process of content creation by removing pure HTML creation. More consistency between pages needed; Rudimentary set of permissions for content authors, so that it is clear who can work on which parts of the website; Some basic security over our content and the information we want and potentially do not want to publish. That was really it. And early content management systems allowed for exactly that. Server side scripting transformed simple templates filled in by authors to HTML. One database stored all the content and managed permissions. Only one distribution channel - the desktop, only static pages served, and finally, only one way communication: from the content authors to the web. Things were simple. Fast forward to the Web 2.0 era. This is when users started generating content. Pages were no longer static, e-commerce had arrived and soon social media started becoming very relevant . The web users now communicate with the businesses in digital. And they expect to be heard. Around that time (2008 - 2010) your CMS should: Support WYSIWYG content authoring; Support complex, publishing workflows; Allow for bi-directional communication with your users; Store and serve various media types, including rich media. Things became much trickier - your CMS then had to support some complex processes and integrate with a lot of different applications (think about all the Wordpress app-like plugins). And this is something it was not designed to do initially. One more jump in time and we are in 2015 - 2017. 2017 was the first year when mobile traffic overtook the desktop . And it has remained so until now. The WWW users now expect a consistent experience between desktop and mobile. There are 1 billion websites in the world. Your CMS has become more of a platform that: Supports all devices; Gathers data and customer intelligence; Is context aware and serves personalized content; Supports multiple infrastructure and deployment models; Integrates seamlessly with 3rd party software. Even though monolithic CMS are still standing strong, it is becoming apparent that at some point, the amount of data, touchpoints and users will become a challenge. Scaling monoliths will be complicated or costly but most likely both. And this is actually how we enter the DXP.","title":"The evolution of WWW and its impact on content management systems"},{"location":"blog/2022/how-has-cms-evolved-into-dxp/#dxp-a-revolution-or-just-next-step","text":"I do not like definitions, so I will not quote Gartner Glossary here. Allow me to list the challenges I think a DXP should address: The ability to deliver contextualized experiences to digital channels (web, mobile, apps, social media, email, IoT devices\u2026) and scale up quickly and at low cost . Consistency between all channels and devices for a full, end to end customer journey. There is nothing more annoying than an empty basket on your mobile app when you've just completed it on a website. One to one personalization. 75% of consumers are likely to buy from companies that are able to suggest a product based on their previous interest, buys and journeys 2 . The ability to extend your customer\u2019s profile by easily connecting other systems - CRM, CDP and similar. Using any tools you like. Due to the architecture of a DXP, you should not be subject to vendor - locking. Instead you are able to build the best digital marketing suite out of the tools and systems you feel are best. You could argue that some of the same issues we were trying to solve as early as in 2016. And I would agree. There is a major factor to consider here though, which is the volume . There is a fantastic book by Vaclav Smil called Numbers don\u2019t lie (I\u2019d recommend you give the entire book a read) and one of the chapters touches on the volume of data we produce. Some facts: In 2018 in the United States, the internet users have downloaded 97000 hours of movies and series from Netflix every minute . They watched 4.5 million Youtube movies and generally transferred a total of 3.1 petabytes of data (that is 3.1 x 10 15 bytes). Again that is every minute . In 2016, the pace in which we produced data was estimated to be 16 zettabytes a year, which is 16 * 10 21 bytes. To put that into perspective: you would have to download the 4k Braveheart movie about 400.000.000.000 times to generate the same volume. It is estimated that by 2025 this number will be ten times higher - 160 zettabytes a year (which is 160 * 10 21 bytes). Somewhere in all of this, is your digital estate and your CMS. So what is a DXP? In essence, a DXP is a technological suite, at heart of which could be the CMS. The suite should be powered by an architecture with loosely - coupled elements that allows you to easily plug in tools (personalization engines, marketing automation, CRM etc.) that improve your user and customer experience. Most importantly however, that architecture should be able to serve all your visitors, channels and data volume now, tomorrow and three years from now, when it becomes even more challenging (as indicated by Professor Smil in his book).

It may be surprising, but WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal are still the most popular options for small and medium companies. Larger ones often choose full-flagged DXPs like Adobe Experience Manager, Sitecore, or Magnolia to fulfill their enterprise needs. All of the solutions above are mature and battle-tested, they adapt to changing world but still use best practices from previous decades. I am not the first one who noticed it. We need applications that are more secure, faster, easier to scale and at the same time cheaper to run and simpler. There are many emerging players available on the market including Jamstack-compatible solutions like Contentful, Webiny, Strapi, and so on. Single Page Applications' popularity and requirements of supporting multiple channels helped Headless CMSs to successfully enter the market. The only problem is that there is always a tradeoff. Headless solutions are often designed to solve certain problems and operate in cloud-native environments, but at the same time are lacking enterprise features (like WYSIWYG authoring, granular role-based security, and multi-site management to name a few), mostly because of simplified underlying data structure (designed for structured content), lightweight programming models, and lack of maturity. We asked ourselves if it is possible to have a solution that combines the advantages of both approaches?? Have mature, tested, and feature-rich platforms and the ability to deliver experiences at web-scale in cloud-native architectures? THE OBSERVATION Like many things in technology, we can search for analogies in real life. The beer is brewed in breweries, but later distributed to bars to make more people enjoy it in a better environment Food comes from multiple sources like farmlands or sea but is later processed and delivered to groceries or served in restaurants A movie is created in a studio, and later watched in multiple places like a cinema or at home Games are developed in studios, but people enjoy it using game consoles or PCs The critical point here is that the place where you create and develop is different from where you consume it. It\u2019s done for multiple reasons: scalability, security, performance, cost, and overall experience. THE IDEA To deliver enterprise experiences at a web scale we decided to resolve the core problem of recent platforms. When you take a look at mature CMS systems like WordPress or AEM, you\u2019ll see that publishers or renderers are almost always technological copies of authoring environments. Of course, it was a natural step, if one instance is not enough to deliver the content, you multiply it and eventually add caching layers to hide architecture limitations. But is it the way it should be? In our vision, CMS has to focus purely on the authoring experience. From the programmer's point of view, we see it as a distributed IDE for content authors. Optimized for content creation, management, and integration of multiple data sources. It should be created to provide a unified environment for preparing customer experiences. What\u2019s important - data itself may come from internal data storage (which should be designed to handle structured and unstructured data) or external sources. Examples of data sources are PIM systems, enterprise applications, or external databases. Everything has to be managed in (not served by) CMS, which plays the role of the content hub. Experiences, once created, should be delivered to the end-users via another, dedicated environment - the runtime. At the same time, we want to avoid any runtime dependencies between runtime and authoring environments. Here the push model comes to play. Runtime should be designed to serve experiences at a true web scale. No more publishers, content synchronization, dispatchers, read-only replicas, and instance multiplication. What could be the ideal place to do that? The answer is simple, the cloud. THE SOLUTION A simplified diagram presents the options we have now. We can choose mature, feature-rich enterprise solutions (on the left), which are often part of closed, proprietary ecosystems, or choose lighter cloud-native alternatives (on the right). Mature CMS\u2019es seem to not keep up with the progress, because of server-oriented architectures which were designed in the 2000s to work on physical machines in dedicated data centers. New headless systems are limited and not complete solutions. They are lacking the integration layer, and the dynamic content is orchestrated directly in the browser, which calls microservices. What if we merge two and take the best from two worlds? Well, we did it and the result is WebSight . As we already know it has two major parts: WebSight CMS - enterprise-grade authoring system created using battle-tested technologies. Apache Sling, Apache Felix, and Apache Oak are a foundation that allows us to take advantage of years of experience from other players. At the same time, we had a chance to avoid many pitfalls and use only components which are ready to work in a container-oriented world. We took the advantage of being able to create our solution from the ground. WebSight Runtime - cloud-native architecture designed to serve experiences in a secure, scalable, and performant way. Its core is cloud-agnostic, but our first implementation is based on AWS. The difference with Jamstack is that the integration and rendering layers are in the cloud, not in a browser. Serverless functions give us more flexibility and fully replace the need for publisher instances at runtime. NEXT STEPS At the time of writing this post, WebSight is a functional product. We use it internally to create the first projects and work on the first public release. We\u2019ll be sharing here the insights into the architecture and development process, so stay tuned, because there's more to come.","title":"On the road to the perfect DXP"},{"location":"blog/2022/on-the-road-to-the-perfect-dxp/#the-problem","text":"It is very easy to get lost when it comes to choosing the technology stack driving your digital projects.

And what was the presentation like? We started by introducing some basic concepts including what the DXP is and how it has grown out of the constraints CMS started to place in regard to building modern customer experience. Next, we talked about milestones in the history of WebSight - from the general idea for a new system, through developing a platform prototype, forming a product team responsible for delivering features to releasing the Early Preview version and its Community Edition. We mentioned those stages in the context of the challenges we came across while developing it, including solutions and tools we had used to address them. Solving problems and adding new items one by one made us evolve so much that now we think about this evolution in terms of the revolution. No doubt, automation turned out to be one of the key points here. Apart from making the whole team work more efficient it has also helped us to transform the QA role within it. More or less traditional quality assurance engineer started to be a quality assistant i.e. an advisor, educator and facilitator with some automation help replaced attended aspects of testing we struggled with before, especially during ineffective regression sessions. And now our quality assistant supports the dev team in their work in the field of testing and automation including strategy, designing, promoting best practices and addressing edge cases. Another point we touched was Selenium or rather why we preferred Cypress. Having a great number of positive experiences from the past, this time we needed a framework that we could launch instantly and that is ready to use and stable. It was also a matter of reaching a compromise and enabling each team member to cover the functionalities and bugfixes she/he delivered with automated checks and as a result growing the culture of developing automated checks within the team. We also gave a short demo of WebSight focused mainly on how and where we make use of automated checking tools when delivering a product. Being a team that builds platforms for delivering Digital Experience, we want the future project based on WebSight to take advantage of our developers' experience and make their start even easier. That\u2019s why starting a new project from our archetype includes fully integrated units and end-to-end (functional + visual) tests. With our approach you can easily launch a product in a cloud environment within a minute and have it validated with automated checks run as a part of the GitHub Actions pipeline. But that\u2019s not the end - we will be extending the template in the future to give the dev team even more ready-to-use quality patterns and techniques (e.g. such as CI configuration or automated performance checks as a part of CI). The QA transformation we did, turned out to be revolutionary but we know it is still not over yet, and there is so much more for us to do\u2026 If you want to read more about this topic, please visit Radek's post on Achieving quality with no dedicated QA Engineers . As for the conference itself, we must admit that the program board made an effort and chose really interesting and diverse subjects thanks to which the content was, as always, at a very high level and its organization was just excellent (the organizers really cared not only about the participants, but also made every effort to make the speakers feel at home). Thanks again, and stay tuned!","title":"Quality transformation in WebSight"},{"location":"blog/2022/shipping-and-developing-osgi-application-in-container/","tags":["WebSight","Containers","Docker","Sling"],"text":"Published at: 02.08.2022 by Maciej Laskowski Modern distributed software systems consist of multiple cooperating software applications. However, to run the application, the software we develop is only one part. The second one is the environment (e.g., JVM and OS). In this article, I will focus on building an OSGi application and explain five benefits we gained thanks to containerizing it. Modularity In the previous article \u201c Building OSGi applications with Sling Feature Model \u201d we discussed modularity on the bundles and features (micro) level. In this article, we analyze another level - application/container. Thanks to containers, we can benefit from micro-level modularity at the application (macro) level. Containers allow us to set up a new, minimal but self-sufficient environment to run the OSGi platform. And because it is so simple, we can prepare many single-purpose, containerized applications. Container images are immutable after creation. And here comes the first tradeoff - modification of applications is no longer an option when the container run. We are not able to use OSGi bundles pluggability in full. We install all necessary bundles in the build time, but no changes or additions are later allowed in the run time. But there is good news. Instead of adding more bundles to the existing applications, we can add entirely new specialized containers and plug them into the system. This approach improves the system architecture by keeping it modular and enables the delivery of the extra piece of functionality independently. Let\u2019s take an example. When running an OSGi environment on a VM was expensive, we were tempted to pack all features into a single application to minimize the setup and management costs. Thanks to containerization we create separate, specialized applications that can combine features and deliver limited functionality. That is a massive step towards a distributed system with applications that have their life cycle and can scale up and down independently. Deployability We already know that the container is immutable. That means all applications inside the container are immutable too. Preparing a container image requires extra effort (e.g., gathering all dependencies the application needs to run). However, we might use the Sling OSGi Feature Model in the case of OSGi applications and let it handle stuff like downloading dependencies. The gain here is confidence. Once the image is ready, it will behave the same way anywhere we deploy it. Of course, there are tradeoffs here too. We will no longer be able to hot reload/install bundles and change configs manually on the production setups. (We can still do it for development purposes, to improve developer experience). The question here is: do we want to do manual changes on production anymore? Imagine having 100 containers to update. Does applying change on all the containers manually even make sense? To be fair, one thing is best practices, and another is having the possibility to do it in emergencies. Let's think about how we can deal with this tradeoff. The answer can be automation. We can implement Continuous Integration and Delivery pipelines to perform changes quickly when necessary and roll back to the previous version in a matter of minutes (which is usually much faster than manual fixes in multiple places). Portability JVM and OSGi give us some level of portability. We can run an OSGi application independently of the operating system (assuming the compatibility of the Java version etc.). Containers give us another level of portability. Once built, we can run a container on our local machine, deploy it to Kubernetes (locally, on-premise, or in the cloud), or use managed container orchestration service, like AWS ECS, and stop worrying about the infrastructure underneath. Containers enable the portability of applications between cloud providers, acting as a runtime standard. Maintainability Another advantage of containers is that they make you think of applications as stateless. Containers should be able to stop or start at any moment for no reason. Since they are self-sufficient, no manual actions are required to spawn a new instance, and no additional downloads happen (it should be done already during the build phase and embedded into the image). That means, having a closed, immutable application, we can test it once and deploy it many times. Also, performing a rollback is an easy operation. From the system\u2019s perspective, it is switching to the previous application version like using an undo shortcut. All those factors make the containerized application easier to maintain. Security Last but not least - the security. Containers give us additional control over the environment like the Operating System and version/type of the Java. Managing it via Dockerfile is considered a standard and low-effort operation nowadays. Additionally, a lot of tooling on the market helps keep containers safe, like vulnerability scanners executed during Continuous Integration. Since we have all dependencies (JARs) inside the container, we can release applications regularly with security updates. There are also other best practices. For example, distroless containers minimize the attack vector (the fewer tools installed in the container, the fewer opportunities to hack in). On the other hand, using managed cloud services to run containers in comparison to running virtual machines limits significantly the number of topics we need to worry about (like patching OS, managing firewall, etc.). Summary In this article, I went through five main system qualities that we improved significantly after switching the development and delivery of our OSGi applications to containers. Containers are no silver bullet, and there were tradeoffs we had to sort out. Yet, we were able to keep the most important benefits of developing OSGi applications like high modularisation and good developer experience. In our situation, the benefits outweighed the costs of containerizing applications.","title":"Why we decided to ship and develop the OSGi application in containers"},{"location":"blog/2022/shipping-and-developing-osgi-application-in-container/#modularity","text":"In the previous article \u201c Building OSGi applications with Sling Feature Model \u201d we discussed modularity on the bundles and features (micro) level.

Containers enable the portability of applications between cloud providers, acting as a runtime standard.","title":"Portability"},{"location":"blog/2022/shipping-and-developing-osgi-application-in-container/#maintainability","text":"Another advantage of containers is that they make you think of applications as stateless. Containers should be able to stop or start at any moment for no reason. Since they are self-sufficient, no manual actions are required to spawn a new instance, and no additional downloads happen (it should be done already during the build phase and embedded into the image). That means, having a closed, immutable application, we can test it once and deploy it many times. Also, performing a rollback is an easy operation. From the system\u2019s perspective, it is switching to the previous application version like using an undo shortcut. All those factors make the containerized application easier to maintain.","title":"Maintainability"},{"location":"blog/2022/shipping-and-developing-osgi-application-in-container/#security","text":"Last but not least - the security. Containers give us additional control over the environment like the Operating System and version/type of the Java. Managing it via Dockerfile is considered a standard and low-effort operation nowadays. Additionally, a lot of tooling on the market helps keep containers safe, like vulnerability scanners executed during Continuous Integration. Since we have all dependencies (JARs) inside the container, we can release applications regularly with security updates. There are also other best practices. For example, distroless containers minimize the attack vector (the fewer tools installed in the container, the fewer opportunities to hack in). On the other hand, using managed cloud services to run containers in comparison to running virtual machines limits significantly the number of topics we need to worry about (like patching OS, managing firewall, etc.).","title":"Security"},{"location":"blog/2022/shipping-and-developing-osgi-application-in-container/#summary","text":"In this article, I went through five main system qualities that we improved significantly after switching the development and delivery of our OSGi applications to containers.

This new RTE plugin was created as a custom, fully customizable component written from scratch for the ds.pl website. Let's follow the process of creating such a component, with a little help from TipTap library , which lies underneath the Rich Text Editor. New component requirements The new component is supposed to add a masked email address to prevent spam messages. An anchor tag should not contain a plain, easy-to-read email address, but instead should use data attributes for storing email parts. An example of a protected email address could look like this: <a href=\"\" data-part1=\"info\" data-part2=\"ds\" data-part3=\"pl\" ... >Contact Us</a> After the page is loaded, the script should convert these data parts into the whole email address, like in a regular link with the mailto: prefix: <a href=\"mailto:info@ds.pl\" ... >Contact Us</a> From the user's perspective, RTE should have a dedicated button which allows users to input an email address and the rest would be happening under the hood. The button could be placed next to the Link button. This is how the RTE component looks like now: Email link obfuscation Please keep in mind that it is only a very basic method of email link obfuscation, chosen from among many other ways of encoding link contents. It will certainly not protect the data from all spambots or harvesters, but should be enough for our current needs. Technical overview Due to component specifcity, the work can be split into two parts: CMS part - where adding/editing/deleting and encrypting email addresses is happening within the Rich Text Editor page part - where RTE configuration and email decoding happens Therefore, the component must be used with the script provided within the page , otherwise, email links won't be decoded. As the decoding email script will be the last step, let's focus on the main issue here - extending the RTE editor. The editor component is made up of two parts: the plugin element and the UI element. The plugin part is responsible for the plugin behavior and it is directly related to the UI part, which is providing the UI for the plugin itself. In Websight CMS, the tiptap library is responsible for plugins and a separate module that is a part of Websight CMS - for UI. As for the plugin, we can either extend or create a new extension. But what about the UI element for this plugin? None of these (button, button dropdown, list dropdown, link) match the requirements, because we need a dropdown with one input (link UI has input and select with target attribute selection). So we need a new UI as well. Hint See our other article about Customizing Rich Text Editor in WebSight CMS , where you can read more about RTE configuration and learn how to create a plugin from predefined components. Page part - configuration Let's start by preparing an extended configuration according to the documentation . The example path for an extended configuration could be /apps/rte/extended/configuration/.content.json . After that we can use this new configuration in our components, just like described here . .../application/backend/src/main/resources/apps/rte/extended/configuration/.content.json { \"sling:resourceSuperType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/configurations/default\" , \"link\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/link\" , \"title\" : \"Link\" , \"icon\" : \"link\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"extensions/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/link\" } }, \"email\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"extensions/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/email\" , \"title\" : \"Email\" , \"icon\" : \"alternate_email\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"extensions/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/email\" }, \"sling:orderBefore\" : \"bulletlist\" } } Available icons Icons are provided by Google font page CMS part - new plugin To connect our JSON configuration above to actual scripts, create the following files with a path pointing to our script: websight-rte-extensions/src/main/resources/libs/extensions/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/email/email.json.html { \"type\" : \"/apps/websight-rte-extensions/web-resources/components/richtext/plugin/Email/Email.js\" } Our new plugin will affect another plugin that is already in the default version in RTE - Link. We need to exclude email handling from the Link plugin , as we will cover that in the email plugin. That means we also need to modify the Link plugin by creating a custom link plugin. So a similar file needs to be created for the link: websight-rte-extensions/src/main/resources/libs/extensions/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/link/link.json.html { \"type\" : \"/apps/websight-rte-extensions/web-resources/components/richtext/plugin/Link/Link.js\" } Then let's create the UI element for e-mail: websight-rte-extensions/src/main/resources/libs/extensions/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/email/email.json.html { \"type\" : \"/apps/websight-rte-extensions/web-resources/components/richtext/ui/EmailDialog.js\" , \"configuration\" : { \"title\" : \"${properties.title}\" , \"icon\" : \"${properties.icon}\" } <sly da ta - sly - lis t = \"${resource.children}\" > <sly da ta - sly - test = \"itemList.first\" > , \"plugin\" : <sly da ta - sly - resource= \"${item}\" ></sly> </sly> </sly> } TipTap There is very supportive tiptap documentation on how to build such custom extensions . In our case we can also just base our code on Link docs and Link code . Extend or write from scratch? Extending an existing component requires less code writing, as we can only replace particular methods. The obvious component, in this case, would be the Link component, as the behavior would be very similar. But the differences are significant, too. Fortunately, there is no need to decide now, as we can simply switch from extending to creating. Some chosen methods from component: extension-email.ts ... const CustomEmail = Mark . create ({ name : 'email' , priority : 1000 , addOptions () { return { linkOnPaste : false , autolink : false , validate : undefined , HTMLAttributes : { rel : 'noopener noreferrer nofollow' , class : null , 'data-part1' : null , 'data-part2' : null , 'data-part3' : null } }; }, onDestroy () { reset (); }, inclusive () { return this . options . autolink ; }, addAttributes () { return { class : { default : this.options.HTMLAttributes.class , }, 'data-part1' : { default : null }, 'data-part2' : { default : null }, 'data-part3' : { default : null } }; }, parseHTML () { return [ { tag : 'a[data-part1][data-part2][data-part3]' }, ]; }, renderHTML ({ HTMLAttributes }) { return [ 'a' , mergeAttributes ( this . options . HTMLAttributes , HTMLAttributes ), 0 , ]; }, ... addProseMirrorPlugins () { const plugins : Plugin [] = []; if ( this . options . autolink ) { plugins . push ( autolink ({ type : this . type , validate : this.options.validate , }), ); } if ( this . options . linkOnPaste ) { plugins . push ( pasteHandler ({ editor : this.editor , type : this . type , }), ); } return plugins ; }, }); export default CustomEmail ; TipTap library is built on top of the ProseMirror package but almost every functionality can be done without any knowledge of it, as TipTap is handling it under the hood. However, for handling some events we need to add the addProseMirrorPlugins() method and inside it create prosemirror plugins to handle this special event-based behavior. Here is an example usage of ProseMirror API , so the helper file would look something like this: helpers/pasteHandler.ts export function pasteHandler ( options : PasteHandlerOptions ) : Plugin { return new Plugin ({ key : new PluginKey ( 'handlePasteEmail' ), props : { handlePaste : ( view , event , slice ) => { ... }, }, }); } Finally, we can create an Email.ts file with the component which loads the previously registered plugin: /apps/websight-rte-extensions/web-resources/components/richtext/plugin/Email/Email.ts import CustomEmail from \"./extension-email.js\" ; import { splitEmail } from \"./helpers/splitEmail.js\" ; import { validateEmail } from \"./helpers/validateEmail.js\" ; const Email = () => ({ getTipTapExtensions : () => [ CustomEmail . configure ({ autolink : true , linkOnPaste : true })], getAction : ({ editor }) => ({ execute : ({ hrefDecoded }) => { if ( validateEmail ( hrefDecoded )) { editor . chain (). focus (). extendMarkRange ( 'email' ). setEmail ({ hrefDecoded , ... splitEmail ( hrefDecoded ) }). run (); } else { editor . chain (). focus (). extendMarkRange ( 'email' ). unsetEmail (). run (); } } }), getState : ({ editor }) => ({ isActive : editor.isActive ( 'email' ), ... editor . getAttributes ( 'email' ) }) }); export default Email ; getTipTapExtension method is doing exactly what its name indicates, as well as making it possible to switch off/on some plugin features execute runs when the user clicks the submit button getState is passing the current editor state Page part once again - decoding script Script for decoding is quite simple, as it is scanning the page and converting three data parts to a proper email address: window . addEventListener ( 'load' , () => { const links = document . querySelectorAll ( '[data-part1][data-part2][data-part3]' ); for ( const link of links ) { const attrs = link . dataset ; link . setAttribute ( 'href' , `mailto: ${ attrs . part1 } @ ${ attrs . part2 } . ${ attrs . part3 } ` ); } }); Result The implemented extension for RTE is presented below. Summary First of all, we created new entries in the richtext JSON configuration file, then we added proper JSON files with paths corresponding to actual scripts. After creating and extending the existing component we could add a simple script for decoding emails on our page. As we can see, Rich Text Editor can be easily extended with any functionality we want, due to the flexible architecture model used in Websight CMS. Furthermore, creating an extension with the TipTap library offers broad possibilities, as well as creating a new UI component within CMS.","title":"Creating a custom extension for Rich Text Editor using TipTap"},{"location":"blog/2023/creating-custom-extension-for-rte/#new-component-requirements","text":"The new component is supposed to add a masked email address to prevent spam messages.

In this post, I present why we need this change. The new approach requires a different CMS architecture. Thus, I describe the current and target architecture in the following sections. Finally, you can find a brief scope of the change and some design decisions we made. Motivation Firstly, let me explain our motivation. WebSight CMS and WebSight DXP are two different products, and we want to ensure each has its unique role. CMS design provides the best authoring experience, while DXP will concentrate on distributing experiences and delivering them efficiently. CMS should be usable on its own. To make this possible, we plan to include response-reply publishing and move the SSG module to DXP. With the new Publishing framework, we will: Make CMS more accessible to existing AEM, Drupal, Sitecore, and WordPress users, Be able to create a scalable publishing farm, Stop using NFS, which is expensive and causes performance issues, Eliminate point-to-point integrations (e.g. CMS-Nginx, CMS-Solr) and use the DXP messaging system for communication in complex systems, Move the responsibility for the event-driven content generation (pre-generation) to DXP. Another reason is the need to determine the state of published experiences. Currently, we can only define the published version of a page, but to display the page, we require the entire context including assets, other pages, and configurations. For instance, to accurately render navigation links with correct titles, we usually need to know the state of the entire published tree. To fulfill this requirement, we need to maintain published data in a separate location, either in a different database or sub-path. Current CMS architecture Right now, CMS uses a push model where pages are rendered and stored on a shared disk that Nginx or Quarkus can access. This approach has advantages such as excellent performance and stability. However, this approach has limitations such as point-to-point integrations, limited throughput on the shared drive, and the incapacity to connect multiple CMS systems or add new destinations. That is why we have decided to move Static Site Generation (SSG) to DXP. Push model in WebSight CMS Target CMS architecture Without the push model, the architecture of CMS becomes simplified to a standard request-reply setup. To boost performance and security, MongoDB can be set up with the master and read-only replicas. Renderers can be stripped of unnecessary modules, to guarantee faster startup times. Kubernetes autoscaling should be utilized to activate renderers only when needed. Request-reply model in WebSight CMS Required changes The new approach requires a few changes. I described them briefly below. Apps activator decommission Both unpublished and published front-end assets come from bundle resources. We need to ensure that: the document root is available for anonymous users, pulsar is notified about required FE libraries/assets to be published. It will be the scope of DXP. Simplifying publishing framework There is no need for processors and custom handlers. There should be only one module that handles copying data from the /content/ to /published/ path. The module needs to: be customizable (to allow plugging custom handlers, for example, to paths rewriting or removing unnecessary properties), allow to add post-publish handlers to, for example, notify Pulsar about publish/unpublish events, or to send published data to S3. Publish status storage change Currently, the publication status is saved in properties of Pages, Assets, and other objects. With the new approach, the status would be determined by evaluating tree data comparison. For instance, to determine if the home page has been published, we need to compare paths: /content/spaceX/pages/homepage/ with /published/spaceX/pages/homepage/ . Modification dates properties and information about author changes can be used to determine the exact status. This way the status will be accurate after copying, moving or restoring the data from the backup. We need to ensure that the new status check algorithm is efficient, as it will be used on every dashboard view. Publishing Algorithm We consider the following ideas related to the new algorithm: Space synchronization before publishing, It\u2019s possible to publish a Page/Asset even if the parent elements are not published, ACL needs to be set in the repository init configuration. Ghost detection After implementing the new publishing, we need to introduce the ghost detection. The ghost object is an object (Page, Asset) that has no authoring representation, but is published. It should be possible to unpublish such an object. Ghost objects should be visible on the dashboard with a dedicated status. The dashboard filter should be extended to find ghost objects easily. We should not unpublish the objects during actions that lead to their removal from /content/ . For example, delete page , move page , backup restore . The same rule applies to objects other than pages (assets, tags). Design decisions The new approach and architecture triggered a lot of discussion in our team. We have still a few open questions. However, we agreed so far on the following items. The publishing framework should be implemented using the JCR API, because spaces, pages, and assets are supported with JCR only. The API should be optimized for performance. CMS doesn't implement static site generation (SSG). This feature will be supported by DXP. We are not going to invest in a complex cache control mechanism (although it\u2019s possible). No cache flush handlers are considered now. Caching in Nginx should be based on the strong and weak HTTP cache. Summary What makes WebSight different is a true separation of concerns. The authoring environment, CMS, is detached from the runtime. Content authors need distributed collaboration platform focused on providing rich authoring features. We designed it specifically to create and manage the content between publications. Once ready, we generate static pages and distribute them with all dependencies to the runtime environment using the push model. However, this is DXP's responsibility. The new publication framework supports the separation and will lead to a better fit for the purpose. We are going to start its implementation soon. Stay tuned!","title":"New publishing framework"},{"location":"blog/2023/new-publishing-framework/#motivation","text":"Firstly, let me explain our motivation. WebSight CMS and WebSight DXP are two different products, and we want to ensure each has its unique role. CMS design provides the best authoring experience, while DXP will concentrate on distributing experiences and delivering them efficiently. CMS should be usable on its own. To make this possible, we plan to include response-reply publishing and move the SSG module to DXP. With the new Publishing framework, we will: Make CMS more accessible to existing AEM, Drupal, Sitecore, and WordPress users, Be able to create a scalable publishing farm, Stop using NFS, which is expensive and causes performance issues, Eliminate point-to-point integrations (e.g. CMS-Nginx, CMS-Solr) and use the DXP messaging system for communication in complex systems, Move the responsibility for the event-driven content generation (pre-generation) to DXP. Another reason is the need to determine the state of published experiences. Currently, we can only define the published version of a page, but to display the page, we require the entire context including assets, other pages, and configurations. For instance, to accurately render navigation links with correct titles, we usually need to know the state of the entire published tree. To fulfill this requirement, we need to maintain published data in a separate location, either in a different database or sub-path.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"blog/2023/new-publishing-framework/#current-cms-architecture","text":"Right now, CMS uses a push model where pages are rendered and stored on a shared disk that Nginx or Quarkus can access.

One such tool is Page Editor, which should support the authoring process while remaining robust and consistent with the page seen by the end user. It\u2019s a common issue that some parts of a page look or work differently in production than during authoring. In this blog post, I\u2019ll explain how we solve it in WebSight CMS using viewport units as an example. Page Editor Page Editor is a core part of WebSight CMS and one of the main tools authors use. It displays the edited page, allowing authors to intuitively build pages in a WYSIWYG way. They can interact with various overlays displayed on top of the canvas while seeing the edited page underneath. To achieve it, the edited page is not displayed naturally, but it\u2019s stretched like a canvas on an easel, taking the full height of its content. I presented it on a diagram below: Stretched page vs workspace The page is stretched to its full height, even though the author only sees a fragment of it in the Workspace. It\u2019s the Workspace that\u2019s scrollable, not the page itself. Such a solution provides great value for authors, but it comes with some limitations. One of the issues is that viewport units do not work properly in such cases because they are based on the edited page\u2019s height instead of the workspace\u2019s height. Issue If developers created a component using the height: 50vh; style it would lead to issues in the Page Editor because the component\u2019s height would not be adequately calculated. It would have a height equal to 50% of the height of the edited page, not 50% of the workspace\u2019s height. It happens, because the edited page is displayed inside of an iframe and the viewport units are relative to the iframe\u2019s size. It\u2019s visualized on a diagram below: The issue with viewport units - inconsistency in the Page Editor Suppose the edited page consists of a component with height: 100vh; and some other elements. In that case, it could even lead to an infinite loop, where the height of the component would be increased to match the page\u2019s height but then the page\u2019s height would be increased to match the component and its siblings. Take a look at the diagram below: The issue with viewport units - infinite loop Component developers could solve these issues by avoiding using the vh units. They could resign from them altogether or conditionally avoid them just in the edit mode of the Page Editor. They would have to do that every time they wanted to use viewport units to style their components. Solution To improve the development experience and make sure the components provided to authors always work well in the Page Editor, we\u2019ve decided to automatically fix such issues. We search for vh based styles in the edited page and substitute them in the edit mode with px values calculated based on the workspace\u2019s height. This way the components using viewport units are correctly displayed in the Page Editor and authors can see them, in the same way, they will appear on a published site: Page editor consistent with a published site Summary In WebSight, we value both the authoring and development experience. Thus, we not only take an extra effort to make creating components simple and robust but we also give a hand to developers to speed things up. Thanks to the solution we propose, the component\u2019s developers don\u2019t need to worry about using viewport units nor spend time on providing custom fixes for such cases.

The ability to work with pages, compare and roll back when needed is a must in a collaborative environment. Luckily it\u2019s also well supported by Apache Sling. In this article, I will explain how to do basic operations using only JCR and Sling APIs. Comparing two versions of a single page on one system Enabling content versioning Sling supports versioning of JCR Resources. JCR Resources are used to represent the content , and as a consequence, it\u2019s possible to version pages, assets, and tags. Unlike other Content Management Systems, we do not store scripts, configurations, and bundles in the JCR, for more information, see this blog post . Before you start Make sure to replace /content/ds-website/pages/home in the examples below with your page path. To make a JCR Resource versionable, we need to add JCR Mixin to it. The easiest way to do it is to execute a script in the Groovy Console : home = session . getNode ( \"/content/ds-website/pages/home\" ); home . addMixin ( \"mix:versionable\" ) // Save is required to get apply mixin session . save (); You can verify the result with the Resource Browser . The resource should now contain new properties. New properties assigned the versioned resource Creating multiple page versions Again, let's use Groovy script to create a couple of versions of a homepage: home = session . getNode ( \"/content/ds-website/pages/home\" ); for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++) { home . checkout (); home . checkin (); } println home . getVersionHistory (); The code above should create 10 versions of a page and print the complete history once done. Note that version creation is relatively expensive, so we should not overuse it. Each version of a resource is stored as a jcr:fronzenNode under /jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/<generated hash> . In my case, the path is /jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/5f/2b/64/5f2b64d2-fdb9-4ed5-af8a-cd92a6971f66 . Accessing page versions There are multiple ways we can access the page versions. Directly by accessing frozen node with .html extension. In my case, it's http://localhost:8080/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/5f/2b/64/5f2b64d2-fdb9-4ed5-af8a-cd92a6971f66/1.10/jcr:frozenNode/jcr:content.html , but it will be unique on every system. Programmatically by using JCR API [1] Using Sling API for getting available versions and fetching versioned content [2] Before using Sling version info, the configuration: org.apache.sling.servlets.get.impl.version.VersionInfoServlet has to be enabled with default values. Once it's done, the versions can be read by visiting the following URL: http://localhost:8080/content/ds-website/pages/home.V.tidy.json . JSON with homepage versions information It's relatively easy to compare two versions by comparing the output of requests to URLs: http://localhost:8080/content/ds-website/pages/home.tidy.5.json;v=1.10 and http://localhost:8080/content/ds-website/pages/home.tidy.5.json It's also possible to read individual components from versioned pages: http://localhost:8080/content/ds-website/pages/home/jcr:content/rootcontainer/header.tidy.5.json;v=1.10 Summary At the time of writing, content versioning is still on our Roadmap .

Content authors use CMS to create an experience by managing content, assets and pages (layout). Once the experience is ready to go public, authors push (in other words, publish) it to the backend experience storage . On the frontend, the experience is delivered to the site visitors . They call the web server , which pulls static HTML files/assets/JavaScript/ CSS scripts from the backened experience storage and serves them immediately. Note The experience storage has no access to CMS. That means that if, for example, there is no page in the storage, then site visitors see a 404 message. The above description is called a push model and assumes that the pages are prepared for the user in advance. Note that within this architecture, it is possible to switch off the CMS part, which has no impact on delivering pages. Our CMS is a Java -based OSGi application ( WebSight CMS CE ) with a NoSQL database ( MongoDB ). WebSight CMS supports content management and the generation of static HTML pages. MongoDB database stores content and assets. Note Multiple instances of WebSight CMS can connect to MongoDB, which supports online deployments and enables CMS scalability. Containers We use containers to ship WebSight CMS for deployment on multiple environments, from developers' local computers to public clouds. Read our \"Why we decided to ship and develop the OSGi application in containers\" article to understand the benefits of containers in our stack. Once developers create a WebSight project using the Maven archetype , they produce the following Docker images: An NGINX image (web server) with addtional project-specific configurations A customized CMS image with core WebSight CMS and project-specific modules and configurations Docker Compose With more than one container in the platform, we need a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, we can use the Compose YAML file model to: Configure all platform components ( services ) Enable communication between them Handle data persistance with volumes The following diagram presents all WebSight CMS containers and volumes together. The diagram above reflects the containers' logical architecture. Docker Compose configuration specifies the following services: The nginx service (experience delivery) The cms service (content management and pages generation) The mongo service (content database) Services use volumes (external storage) to save durable data outside the container to separate the lifecycle of containers that use it from the data itself. When Docker Compose destroys a container (e.g., on crash or re-deploy), all data from its internal storage is lost. We specify the following volumes: The experience storage volume is shared by NGINX (read) and WebSight CMS (write) containers The content volume keeps content and assets The logs volume keeps all WebSight CMS application logs Environments Working with containers enables consistency and standardization. With Docker, we can use the same tooling to work locally as well as to deploy production environments to the cloud. For example: When using Docker Compose, the same command is responsible for creating local and cloud instances ( docker compose up ).

Our CMS is a Java -based OSGi application ( WebSight CMS CE ) with a NoSQL database ( MongoDB ). WebSight CMS supports content management and the generation of static HTML pages. MongoDB database stores content and assets. Note Multiple instances of WebSight CMS can connect to MongoDB, which supports online deployments and enables CMS scalability.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"docs/architecture/#containers","text":"We use containers to ship WebSight CMS for deployment on multiple environments, from developers' local computers to public clouds. Read our \"Why we decided to ship and develop the OSGi application in containers\" article to understand the benefits of containers in our stack.

With Compose, we can use the Compose YAML file model to: Configure all platform components ( services ) Enable communication between them Handle data persistance with volumes The following diagram presents all WebSight CMS containers and volumes together. The diagram above reflects the containers' logical architecture. Docker Compose configuration specifies the following services: The nginx service (experience delivery) The cms service (content management and pages generation) The mongo service (content database) Services use volumes (external storage) to save durable data outside the container to separate the lifecycle of containers that use it from the data itself. When Docker Compose destroys a container (e.g., on crash or re-deploy), all data from its internal storage is lost. We specify the following volumes: The experience storage volume is shared by NGINX (read) and WebSight CMS (write) containers The content volume keeps content and assets The logs volume keeps all WebSight CMS application logs","title":"Docker Compose"},{"location":"docs/architecture/#environments","text":"Working with containers enables consistency and standardization.

Layers consist of features (see Sling Feature Model for more details), which are more high-level logical units (like site management or assets management). Layers details This section describes each layer with its responsibilities: Our platform supports multi-site management. Developers can configure site mappings (short URLs, vanity URLs) and restrictions for site components. Sites can have independent release lifecycles or be aggregated into a single container for cost savings. With the sites management feature, authors can drag and drop site components to manage web pages and control their layouts. Clients can reuse our component libraries (Howlite, Bulma) to optimise the time needed to enable site creation or create custom ones. With OSGi pluggability and Sling Feature configurability, our platform is composed of multiple low-level modules (OSGi bundles) organized into more general functionalities called features. While WebSight offers basic core features such as sites and assets management, our clients can also easily add custom features without making modifications to the platform codebase. Moreover, plugins allow clients to extend a user interface beyond the core features with custom actions, panels or even dashboards. React is our first choice for building resource-oriented views. Each view is a single-page application with extension points for dynamically loaded React components. However, adding custom views with other JS Frameworks like Vue.js or Angular is as simple as adding libraries and bootstrapping the app. It is a framework for building extendable web resource-oriented platforms. It separates presentation and business logic layers allowing developers to configure custom views and extend existing ones without modifying the codebase. Its core modules simplify building RESTful APIs, configuring resource-oriented web views and injecting HTML fragments into the existing ones. Built on top of the open-source Apache Software Foundation stack: Apache Sling - a framework for RESTful web applications, Apache Felix - an implementation of the OSGi Framework and Service platform, Apache Jackrabbit Oak - an implementation of Java Content Repository (JCR).

The Docker Compose CLI fully integrates with the Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) . It allows you to create and manage the task definitions, tasks and services using Compose YAML configuration files. The Docker Compose CLI relies on CloudFormation to manage AWS Resources. Docker allows users to define environments in a declarative way. As a result, switching between local environments and ECS environments is as easy as switching your Docker Context (Any AWS-specific configurations is stored in the Docker Compose YAML file.) Notice If you set up the WebSight CMS CE environment on AWS presented by following the steps in this tutorial, you will incur AWS fees of approximately 3 dollars per day, because these steps are not compatible with the AWS free tier. Prerequisites After completing the Creating and developing WebSight CMS project guide you should have: Docker installed and running on your local machine. Java 17 (e.g. AdoptOpenJDK 17 ) and Maven installed on your local machine. To complete this tutorial, you will also need: An AWS account with permissions for Docker Compose ECS integraion . The AWS CLI set up on your local machine and configured with your AWS credentials. Step 1: AWS configuration Register a new domain with Route53 . Request a public certificate using AWS Certificate Manager . Validate domain ownership for the created public certificate. Create two private image repositories : Set the CMS image Repository name to <your-project-name>-cms-ce , e.g. luna-cms-ce . Set the NGINX image Repository name to <your-project-name>-nginx-ce , e.g. luna-nginx-ce . Step 2: Project configuration In this step, we will start with the project generated in the Setup guide and update our Docker and Maven configuration files as needed. Docker For the sake of simplicity, we set the remote environment configuration in the same repository as the project. Create an environment/remote directory. Create environment/remote/admin_password.txt and environment/remote/mongo_password.txt files and fill them with random passwords (both should be single-line documents). Copy environment/local/docker-compose.yml to environment/remote . Add a secrets section in environment/local/docker-compose.yml : secrets : admin_password : file : ./admin_password.txt mongo_password : file : ./mongo_password.txt Replace the volumes section with: volumes : cms_logs : mongo_repository : site_repository : Change the cms service definition to: cms : image : <CMS_ECR_IMAGE_URI> deploy : resources : limits : cpus : '0.5' memory : 2048M ports : - target : 8080 published : 8080 x-aws-protocol : http environment : - WS_ADMIN_USERNAME=wsadmin - MONGODB_HOST=mongo - MONGODB_PORT=27017 - MONGODB_USERNAME=mongoadmin volumes : - cms_logs:/websight/logs - site_repository:/websight/docroot secrets : - source : admin_password target : admin.password - source : mongo_password target : mongo.password depends_on : - mongo CMS_ECR_IMAGE_URI - replace with the appropriate CMS repository URI from the AWS ECR dashboard x-aws-protocol - configure according to your setup for AWS ALB; read more here Change the mongo service definition to: mongo : image : mongo:4.4.6 deploy : resources : limits : cpus : '1' memory : 4096M environment : - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=mongoadmin - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/mongo.password volumes : - mongo_repository:/data/db secrets : - source : mongo_password target : mongo.password Change the nginx service definition to: nginx : image : <NGINX_ECR_IMAGE_URI> ports : - target : 80 published : 80 x-aws-protocol : http volumes : - site_repository:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro NGINX_ECR_IMAGE_URI - replace with the NGINX repository URI from AWS ECR dashboard x-aws-protocol - configure according to your setup for AWS ALB; read more here Add an x-aws-cloudformation section with a Load Balancer configuration: x-aws-cloudformation : Resources : Cms8080TargetGroup : Properties : HealthCheckProtocol : HTTP HealthCheckPort : 8080 HealthCheckPath : /system/health Matcher : HttpCode : 200 Nginx80TargetGroup : Properties : HealthCheckProtocol : HTTP HealthCheckPort : 80 HealthCheckPath : /health Matcher : HttpCode : 200 Cms8080Listener : Properties : Certificates : - CertificateArn : \"<CERTIFICATE_ARN>\" Protocol : HTTPS Port : 8443 Nginx80Listener : Properties : Certificates : - CertificateArn : \"<CERTIFICATE_ARN>\" Protocol : HTTPS Port : 443 CERTIFICATE_ARN - replace with the ARN of the certificate generated in the AWS Configuration step.

Maven Update the io.fabric8:docker-maven-plugin plugin configuration in distribution/pom.xml . Add the following buildx extension to cms and nginx images <build> sections: <buildx> <platforms> <platform> linux/amd64 </platform> <platform> linux/arm64 </platform> </platforms> </buildx> Add the following execution : <execution> <id> push-docker-image </id> <phase> package </phase> <goals> <goal> push </goal> </goals> </execution> Add the <docker.skip.push>true</docker.skip.push> property to the main pom.xml . Alternatively, you can refer to the above configuration in WebSight Starter Distribution POM (where Maven profiles are used). Step 3: Build and deployment Log in to ECR . In the project root run mvn clean install -D docker.cms-project.name=<CMS_ECR_IMAGE_URI> -D docker.nginx.name=<NGINX_ECR_IMAGE_URI> -D docker.skip.push=false . Switch the Docker context to ECS docker context use ws-ecs . From environment/remote run docker compose --project-name \"websight-in-aws\" up . It may take a couple of minutes to finish. Route your domain to the Application Load Balancer that was created by Docker Compose in the previous step by creating a new Hosted Zone . Step 4: Verification Check the ECS Console to verify that all cluster services are running. Open the WebSight CMS CE admin panel by navigating to <your-domain>:8443 in a browser. Use wsadmin as the login name. The password is the password you configured in environment/remote/admin_password.txt . Cleaning up To shut down your environment on AWS (and stop incurring AWS costs), follow these steps: From environment/remote run docker compose --project-name \"websight-in-aws\" down . It may take a couple of minutes to complete. Delete the EFS file systems for cms_logs , mongo_repository , and site_repository volumes. Delete the Route53 Hosted Zone created in the Deployment step. Delete the certificate created in the AWS Configuration step. Delete the ECR repositories created in the AWS Configuration step. AWS best practices This section descirbes best practices for deploying WebSight CE DXP to AWS ECS. Logs and monitoring It's always a good idea to configure logs and observability metrics for your instance. Thanks to the Docker Compose integration with AWS ECS, the AWS CloudWatch Logs service is automatically configured for your containers . Additionally, you can monitor basic metrics using the CloudWatch metrics for the Fargate launch type. Secrets Use Docker secrets for storing any sensitive data (like passwords, tokens, etc.) within your environment. The Docker Compose integration with AWS ECS creates a new secret in the AWS Secrets Manager for each secret defined in the Compose configuration file . See the examples below. Custom CMS admin credentials WebSight CE CMS enables configuration of a custom admin username and password. The default values for the admin user's username/password are wsadmin/wsadmin . You can configure a custom username by setting the WS_ADMIN_USERNAME environment variable . To configure a custom password use the admin.password secret. To do this, first create a secrets file that is readable by Compose during deployment: admin_password.txt s33cretP@ssword Then, reference the file in the Compose configuration: docker-compose.yml service : cms : secrets : - source : admin_password target : admin.password secrets : admin_password : file : ./admin_password.txt Custom MongoDB password By default, ECS Tasks configured by the Docker Compose integration have public IP addresses assigned to them. Therefore, you should consider securing MongoDB, which by default starts with no username/password configured.

It assumes you have completed the project setup guide and generated a new project from the Maven archetype. All the screens and examples presented below refer to the project prepared in these previous steps. Note You don\u2019t need to read and understand all of the linked content; the basic concepts will be explained here. WebSight CMS is based on Apache Sling , which is \u201ca framework for RESTful web-applications based on an extensible content tree\u201d\u200b\u200b and the OSGi specification - a \u201cJava framework specification that supports the deployment of extensible and downloadable applications known as bundles\u201d. What does this mean? Let's explore by discussing the two most important aspects of the technologies WebSight CMS is based on: OSGi bundles and Resources. OSGi bundle An OSGi bundle is a unit of modularization in the OSGi specification. It's a bundle comprised of Java classes and other resources, which together can provide functions to end users. Open http://localhost:8080/system/console/bundles to see all the Bundles on the WebSight CMS instance and use the filter bar at the top to filter the list. Some of the bundles deliver the OSGi specification implementation (note that the list is filtered by org.apache.felix and that Apache Felix is an implementation of the OSGi specification): Some of the bundles deliver Apache Sling functionality (list filtered by org.apache.sling): Some of the bundles deliver WebSight CMS functionality (list filtered by WebSight): And finally, some of the bundles deliver the functionality of the application which was just generated from the archetype (list filtered by my-artifactId which was used in example project generation at the beginning of our tutorial guide): Click on my-artifactId-backend bundle to open details. At the beginning the bundle definitions were mentioned: OSGi bundle is a unit of modularization in the OSGi specification. Again, a bundle is comprised of Java classes and other resources, which together can provide functions to end users. The screen below highlights that the my-artifactId-backend is exporting (in other words, making available to other bundles) some Java packages (with use of the Export-Package standard OSGi bundle header provided by bnd-maven-plugin in pom.xml and package-info.java files in the code base) and is providing some resources (with use of Sling-Bundle-Resources bundle header handled by Bundle Resources Provider). Resources As we mentioned, WebSight CMS is based on Apache Sling , which \u201cis a framework for RESTful web applications based on an extensible content tree\u201d. It is important to understand the concept of an \u201cextensible content tree,\u201d so let's discuss in a bit more detail. The WebSight CMS Resource Browser admin tool allows developers to browse all Resources available on the instance. Resources are organized in the tree and every resource has a path and properties. Resources are abstractions that represent objects that might come from different sources. The Resource Browser provides an option to select Providers (sources of Resources available in the instance) used to display the presented Resources tree. We will focus on JCR and Bundle resources. http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/ JCR (Java Content Repository) is a database with a tree structure consisting of nodes with properties. Nodes in JCR are reflected by the JCR Resource in the Resources tree. JCR is based on the Java specification and implemented by Apache Jackrabbit, which is also part of Sling and WebSight CMS (check the bundles list mentioned in the previous chapter and filter by org.apache.jackrabbit to see related bundles). For additional technical details refer to these links (which may be interesting but are not necessary for following this guide, because we explain within the guide everything you need to know for our purposes): https://sling.apache.org/documentation/the-sling-engine/resources.html https://jackrabbit.apache.org/jcr/jcr-api.html https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/spec/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0/ Content stored in JCR is represented by JCR Resources (provided to the Resources tree by the JCR Resource provider). WebSight CMS stores JCR content in MongoDB by default (other setups are possible, but we won't cover them here). JCR is used for all the content created during content authoring. Every created page and every added component are represented by nodes (with properties containing data) in the JCR and Resources tree. Resources could also be provided by OSGi Bundles. From the perspective of the Resources tree and Resource abstraction, there is no difference between resources provided by bundles and JCR. However, the bundle resources are read-only, so they would not be suitable for authorable content, but they are great for providing applications. The application resources provided by bundles are available as long as the bundle is available, and they are not stored in JCR. This means application data is not mixed with content data, making it easy to implement blue-green deployments, CI/CD and separation of concerns. For additional technical details check out this link: https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/bundle-resources-extensions-bundleresource.html This is how bundle resources are provided in the generated project: And the same resource in the resource browser: http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/apps/example-project/components/hello This is how JCR resources are defined in the codebase in the content module: And in the Resources tree: http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/content/example-project/pages/homepage/jcr:content Backend Resources The generated application/backend module contains (in the src/main/resources folder) some example application resources needed to work with Pages in WebSight CMS. The resources structure starts at the /apps/example-project path. This path is set in the proper OSGi bundle header to provide information about resources delivered by the bundle. The following resources are defined: . \u2514\u2500\u2500 apps \u2514\u2500\u2500 example-project - application root \"sling:resourceType\": \"ws:Application\" \u251c\u2500\u2500 components - folder containing components \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 container - example container component \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 hello - example component \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 page - example page component \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates - templates folder \u251c\u2500\u2500 contentpage - example page template \u2514\u2500\u2500 pagesspace - example pages space template The application root should be under the /apps or /libs resource and must contain the property sling:resourceType\" = \"ws:Application . Folders containing components and templates must be named components and templates and be under the application root resource. Different relative paths could be set by providing components or templates properties with relative paths (relative to application root resource) to components or templates folders located under the application root resource. Otherwise, components and templates will not be available in the authoring UI. Pages Space template In WebSight CMS, content is organized in Spaces. Spaces are areas where dedicated teams can work on content. WebSight CMS allows the creation of two types of spaces: Assets (Digital Assets Manager) - allows managing assets Pages - allows managing pages and assets (includes the same functionality as Assets Space and more) The content module in the project generated from the archetype contains the Pages Space instance Example project , which is visible in the All Spaces view. A new Space can be created from the UI: In the second step, the Space template needs to be selected for Pages Space creation. The list contains the Example Project Pages template defined using the /apps/example-project/templates/pagesspace resource. The Pages Space template resource must have sling:resourceType set to ws:PagesTemplate and should provide the allowedChildren property (which defines the list of allowed pages templates to create). Another Pages Space template could be defined in the application if needed. For example: /apps/example-project/templates/anotherpagesspace { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"ws:PagesTemplate\" , \"title\" : \"Another Example Project Pages\" , \"allowedChildren\" : [ \"/apps/example-project/templates/contentpage\" ] } To deploy the updated bundle to the running instance, use the command from the backend module folder: mvn clean install -P autoInstallBundle A new Pages Space template will be available: Page template Pages spaces are for page management. To create a new page, a page template is needed. The generated backend module provides an example page template resource /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage sling:resourceType property of the page template must be ws:PageTemplate . title and description properties are used in UI. the allowedChildren property contains an array of page templates that can be created under pages created from this template. The Content Page template allows for the creation of subpages of the same type. The /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage was listed in allowedChildren property in the Pages Space template ( /apps/example-project/templates/pagesspace ). This is a template of the Example Project space: This means that the page template /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage can be created under the page's root in the space: http://localhost:8080/apps/websight/index.html/content/example-project/pages (click Create Page button) In the second step, page properties can be set: The dialog displayed at this step is a dialog of the component defined in the initial content of the page template ( sling:resourceType\": \"example-project/components/page ). Read more about components and dialogs in the Components section of the WebSight CMS documentation. The initial content of the page template is defined in a resource named initial , which is located under the page template resource. The initial content is copied to initialize the created page. Properties are set via a dialog on the copied page content. Page is a node of type ws:Page . It contains a page content sub-node named jcr:content of the type ws:PageContent . The nodes located under the page content node can be modified via the authoring UI. All the Page properties (including properties set via the page dialog) are set on the page content node. This is the initial content of the /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage page template: This is how the content node of the newly created page appears: New page templates can be created in the application. /apps/example-project/templates/examplpage is a copy of /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage with changed title, allowedChildren /apps/example-project/templates/examplpage { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"ws:PageTemplate\" , \"title\" : \"Example Page\" , \"description\" : \"Example Project\" , \"allowedChildren\" : [ \"/apps/example-project/templates/examplpage\" ] } and initial content: { \"jcr:primaryType\" : \"ws:Page\" , \"jcr:content\" : { \"jcr:primaryType\" : \"ws:PageContent\" , \"sling:resourceType\" : \"example-project/components/page\" , \"container\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"example-project/components/container\" , \"hello\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"example-project/components/hello\" }, \"hello1\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"example-project/components/hello\" , \"helloName\" : \"Example\" } } } } To make it possible to create under the pages' root in the space, you must add it to allowedChildren in the pages space template /apps/example-project/templates/pagesspace : Deploy changes again with: mvn clean install -P autoInstallBundle The new template is available to create in the pages' root: Page created from this template contains defined initial content: Components Content is assembled from components. Components are elements that render parts of content according to implemented functionality. To understand the components concept see the Components section of the WebSight CMS documentation. The generated backend module contains three example components, located under /apps/example-project/components page - component used to render page content node container - container component, which allows adding child components via the authoring UI hello - component that displays hello text In the editor components list, only the hello component is visible because other components are hidden via the group property value. http://localhost:8080/apps/websight/index.html/content/example-project/pages/new-page::editor New components can be defined to deliver application functionality. As an example, we will add a new component named Rich Text, which allows for advanced text editing. First, create new folder under /apps/example-project/components named richtext with content: { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"ws:Component\" , \"title\" : \"Rich Text\" , \"description\" : \"Allows advanced text edition\" , \"group\" : \"Example Project\" } Then, define the dialog resource: { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/dialog\" , \"richtext\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext\" , \"label\" : \"Text\" , \"name\" : \"text\" } } Define also the rendering script richtext.html (name must be matching component resource name + .html): < sly data-sly-test = \"${properties.text && properties.text != '<p></p>'}\" > ${properties.text @ context='html'} </ sly > See the Components documentation for more details. This is how the new component definition looks in the codebase. Deploy the change with the command from the backend module: mvn clean install -P autoInstallBundle The new component is available now in the editor and can be added to the page. If text is not configured via dialog, nothing is rendered because of the data-sly-test statement in the component renderer. If nothing is rendered by the component the placeholder is displayed automatically in the editor. The edit action can be used to open dialog, and you can use the rich text dialog input to configure the text. Frontend Frontend scripts and resources are provided by the frontend module, which is a webpack project containing the application frontend. During the build, the resources are embedded into a bundle, which is then deployed to the instance. The generated module contains a simple CSS class to center the text used in the hello component. The CSS files are built into the main.css file by webpack and embedded into the OSGi bundle installed on the instance, which makes the files available as resources (because of the Sling-Bundle-Resources header in the bundle header). Frontend resources are published automatically via the WebSight-Apps-WebRoot bundle header (see next chapter about publishing). The CSS file is included in the page component renderer to load the CSS. http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/apps/example-project/webroot/main.css Add the hello component to the page to see the centered hello text Publishing Assembled content can be previewed in the editor and published to make it available for end users. http://localhost:8080/apps/websight/index.html/content/example-project/pages/new-page::editor The published page is served by an NGINX Web server container: http://localhost/new-page.html End-to-end tests The test module contains content used during end-to-end test execution to validate the application. See the example test content and test script for the hello component: Next steps Congratulations! You've learned the application development process for WebSight CMS.

WebSight CMS is based on Apache Sling , which is \u201ca framework for RESTful web-applications based on an extensible content tree\u201d\u200b\u200b and the OSGi specification - a \u201cJava framework specification that supports the deployment of extensible and downloadable applications known as bundles\u201d. What does this mean? Let's explore by discussing the two most important aspects of the technologies WebSight CMS is based on: OSGi bundles and Resources.","title":"Application development"},{"location":"docs/developers/app-development/#osgi-bundle","text":"An OSGi bundle is a unit of modularization in the OSGi specification. It's a bundle comprised of Java classes and other resources, which together can provide functions to end users. Open http://localhost:8080/system/console/bundles to see all the Bundles on the WebSight CMS instance and use the filter bar at the top to filter the list. Some of the bundles deliver the OSGi specification implementation (note that the list is filtered by org.apache.felix and that Apache Felix is an implementation of the OSGi specification): Some of the bundles deliver Apache Sling functionality (list filtered by org.apache.sling): Some of the bundles deliver WebSight CMS functionality (list filtered by WebSight): And finally, some of the bundles deliver the functionality of the application which was just generated from the archetype (list filtered by my-artifactId which was used in example project generation at the beginning of our tutorial guide): Click on my-artifactId-backend bundle to open details. At the beginning the bundle definitions were mentioned: OSGi bundle is a unit of modularization in the OSGi specification. Again, a bundle is comprised of Java classes and other resources, which together can provide functions to end users. The screen below highlights that the my-artifactId-backend is exporting (in other words, making available to other bundles) some Java packages (with use of the Export-Package standard OSGi bundle header provided by bnd-maven-plugin in pom.xml and package-info.java files in the code base) and is providing some resources (with use of Sling-Bundle-Resources bundle header handled by Bundle Resources Provider).","title":"OSGi bundle"},{"location":"docs/developers/app-development/#resources","text":"As we mentioned, WebSight CMS is based on Apache Sling , which \u201cis a framework for RESTful web applications based on an extensible content tree\u201d. It is important to understand the concept of an \u201cextensible content tree,\u201d so let's discuss in a bit more detail. The WebSight CMS Resource Browser admin tool allows developers to browse all Resources available on the instance. Resources are organized in the tree and every resource has a path and properties. Resources are abstractions that represent objects that might come from different sources. The Resource Browser provides an option to select Providers (sources of Resources available in the instance) used to display the presented Resources tree. We will focus on JCR and Bundle resources. http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/ JCR (Java Content Repository) is a database with a tree structure consisting of nodes with properties. Nodes in JCR are reflected by the JCR Resource in the Resources tree. JCR is based on the Java specification and implemented by Apache Jackrabbit, which is also part of Sling and WebSight CMS (check the bundles list mentioned in the previous chapter and filter by org.apache.jackrabbit to see related bundles). For additional technical details refer to these links (which may be interesting but are not necessary for following this guide, because we explain within the guide everything you need to know for our purposes): https://sling.apache.org/documentation/the-sling-engine/resources.html https://jackrabbit.apache.org/jcr/jcr-api.html https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/spec/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0/ Content stored in JCR is represented by JCR Resources (provided to the Resources tree by the JCR Resource provider). WebSight CMS stores JCR content in MongoDB by default (other setups are possible, but we won't cover them here). JCR is used for all the content created during content authoring. Every created page and every added component are represented by nodes (with properties containing data) in the JCR and Resources tree. Resources could also be provided by OSGi Bundles. From the perspective of the Resources tree and Resource abstraction, there is no difference between resources provided by bundles and JCR. However, the bundle resources are read-only, so they would not be suitable for authorable content, but they are great for providing applications. The application resources provided by bundles are available as long as the bundle is available, and they are not stored in JCR. This means application data is not mixed with content data, making it easy to implement blue-green deployments, CI/CD and separation of concerns. For additional technical details check out this link: https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/bundle-resources-extensions-bundleresource.html This is how bundle resources are provided in the generated project: And the same resource in the resource browser: http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/apps/example-project/components/hello This is how JCR resources are defined in the codebase in the content module: And in the Resources tree: http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/content/example-project/pages/homepage/jcr:content","title":"Resources"},{"location":"docs/developers/app-development/#backend-resources","text":"The generated application/backend module contains (in the src/main/resources folder) some example application resources needed to work with Pages in WebSight CMS.

It also shows how to use components in the WebSight CMS authoring interface. In this documentation we use the follow terms: WebSight CMS pages editor: Refers to the UI for authoring page content WebSight Resource Browse: Refers to the administration tool that allows users to see the resources (data and application) that are available on the WebSight CMS instance Both views can be opened from the WebSight UI: Check the WebSight project setup documentation to see more details about: what WebSight CMS is, and what it gives you implementing applications for WebSight CMS Community Edition the role of OSGi, OSGi bundles, Sling Resources, JCR and more in WebSight CMS What is component Components are: elements that render parts of content according to implemented functionality used to assemble content (like pages) available in the WebSight CMS authoring interface reusable configurable by editing properties on created components instances implemented by developers shipped in OSGi bundles that are deployed to a WebSight CMS instance Components can: include (embed) other components extend other components deliver initial content define dialogs, which are used to edit properties on component instances be containers (allowing you to add child components during authoring) define allowed child components (in the case of containers) Using components To provide more context on components, let's look at the authoring interface and content data structure. The WebSight CMS page editor lists all available components that can be used to build pages on a given WebSight instance. Available components depend on the OSGi bundles that delivering components installed on the instance. Those components can be added to the page by dragging them to the page content view at the center of the screen. Components definitions listed in the WebSight CMS page editor. You can check the page content structure in the page editor content tree tab. This view presents the components tree under page content. This example page contains just the Page Section component, which is the only component present currently in the page content of this example page. Page content tree in the editor. The Page Section component is a container. It allows you to add other components via the authoring interface. The page editor content section displays an empty Page Section component as a box containing the placeholder text \"Drag components here.\" After dragging and dropping the Title and Rich Text components, the page content tree is updated with new nodes. The nodes visible in the content tree are the instances of components. Title and Rich Text components are not containers, so other components cannot be added as their child components. While dragging other components from the components list, the new items can be added next to those components as other children on the Page Section component. After adding a component to the page, the edit action can be used to edit the selected component instance. The dialog that is displayed is a part of the component definition. It is defined by the developer implementing a given component by setting the proper dialog fields (see more in the Dialogs documentation). Properties set via the dialog are saved at edited component instances, and are used by the component to render the appropriate part of content based on the implemented functionality. For example, the Title component renders the Heading text field value in the HTML <h> tag and allows you to set <h> tag level and styling. Components are reusable. Another Title component can be added to the page and configured with its own data. After the second title, the Cards List component is added now. This component is a container but implemented to work with specific type of child components: Only Card Item components can be added inside (this behavior is part of the Cards List component definition). The Cards List component defines initial content that is added to the page when adding a component. The initial content contains 3 child Card Item components (to save work during authoring and present the component in an initialized state). In the content tree, you can see that the Card Item components are child components of the Cards List component. You can continue with assembling and configuring page content based on the available components. Component definition Components are implemented by developers and delivered as resources following a defined structure. The resources should be provided in the OSGi bundle. See the project setup documentation for more details. In this section we will see how the component definition resources structure should look. Simple component definition example Let's see what a simple component definition looks like. We see a component named Say Hello . It provides dialog with one text field, which can be used in the authoring interface to set the hello text rendered on the page using the <p> HTML tag. If the property is not set, Hello World! text will be used. The example application delivers the resource /apps/example-site/components/hello , which is a component definition. It contains just three properties: sling:resourceType = ws:Component which makes this resource the component definition title = Say Hello which is the title of the component visible in the authoring UI group = Example group which is a group name visible in the authoring UI Example component definition in the WebSight Resource Browser. The component is visible in the WebSight CMS page editor. After adding it to the page, it renders \u2018Hello World!\u2019 text. Because the Say Hello component was added to the edited page, the corresponding node was created in the page content: The Hello World! text is rendered in the view because of the hello.html resource defined under the component definition resource that contains the script used to render the content node. The script renders the helloText property value -- or Hello World! , if the property value is empty (it's empty for now, so we see the fallback text). Example component renderer in the WebSight Resource Browser. The second resource under the component definition is the dialog resource. This is the dialog definition resource. It contains a sling:resourceType = wcm/dialogs/dialog property, which defines how the dialog should be displayed (see more details in below) and it has sub-node called helloText that defines the text field ( sling:resourceType = wcm/dialogs/textfield ) input with the label Hello Text . Example component dialog resources in the WebSight Resource Browser. Because the dialog is defined, the edit action in the editor allows you to open the dialog as a set value of the text field. The property value is set on the content node of this Say Hello component instance at the helloText property (according to the name property value at the text field node in the dialog definition): And now the component renderer script will display the property value instead of fallback text: Let's explore all the options and details of the component definition. Component definition properties The component definition is a Sling Resource with resource type ws:Component . Use the following resource properties to define the component: Component property Required Value Description sling:resourceType Yes ws:Component Defines that this resource is a component definition. sling:resourceSuperType No super resource type Set this property to make your component extend another component. That way, the extended component elements can be reused in the extending components. Example value: wcm/core/components/page title Yes string Component name visible in UI. Example value: Title group Yes string Component group name. Allows us to present related components in the UI. Used while defining allowedComponents. Use the value .hidden to make the component definition not visible in the UI. Example value: General isContainer No boolean, false by default Defines the component as a container. Containers are components that contain child components that can be added, removed and reordered using the authoring interface. If true, the allowedComponents property is required too. allowedComponents No* array of strings. Values are absolute component paths and group names. No default value; by default nothing is allowed. Array listing allowed child component absolute paths or groups that can be added to the container. *Required if isContainer=\u201dtrue\u201d . Example value: [ \"/apps/my-app/components/component1\", \"/apps/my-app/components/component2\", \"Content\", \"Blog\" ] isLayout No boolean, false by default Defines the component as a layout component. Layout components are displayed in a separate section in the WebSight CMS pages editor from components that are not layout components. It\u2019s up to the component developer to set isLayout=true , but the guideline is to use it for components that: - are used to define page layout - must contain other components to be usable - contain no logic (other than logic related to layout calculation) - interact only on page resize (no other \u201cuser actions\u201d allowed) - have no visible UI elements (like texts) Examples of Layouts: - 2-column container - 1-column container - Section with title, image, text and CTA (container including components) Example of components that are not Layouts: - image, title or CTA, all of which have visible UI elements (like texts) - logo cloud, which contain very specific CSS logic and should not be used to create generic page layouts) - Accordion, which contains logic not related to layout calculation - Image gallery, which contains logic not related to layout calculation instanceResourceType No resource type that will be set on created component instance If this property is not set, the resource type of every created component instance node will be set to a value resolved from the component definition resource path. If set, then this property value will be used instead. This allows multiple components definitions, which will result with the same resource type used for created component instances. It could be used to deliver components (or layout components) with different initial content. For example: The Section layout component contains an embedded Title component and is a container that renders child components below the Title . If the authoring section with four columns needs to be created, then the Section component needs to be added with four containers inside that are configured to be displayed as columns. If this page layout is commonly used during content authoring then a new layout component could be implemented to simplify the process. A Section with four columns layout component could be added. The instanceResourceType property should be set to the Section component resource type and initial content should provide the same structure as was created manually before (a section plus four configured child containers). This way, after dropping Section with four columns on the page, the commonly used content structure will be ready to use immediately. Example value: my-app/components/section Dialog Dialog is the form with inputs that allows you to set data on component instances in content. The form layout, fields and behavior are described by resources starting at a resource named dialog defined under the component definition resource. If the dialog resource is not defined, then the edit component properties action is not available in the editor. This is what the dialog definition structure looks like with the same dialog displayed in the editor: Component dialog resources structure in Resource Browser tool. Component dialog displayed after edit component action in pages editor. Dialog for editing component properties is opened in edit:dialog context - the context can be used to disable some fields depending on the dialog usage. Read more about context and other aspects of the dialogs in the Dialogs documentation . Rendering script To render components, the rendering script file resource is needed. The file resource name should be the same as the component name with the .html extension (the recommended and supported scripting language in the WebSight CMS is the HTML Templating Language, or HTL). See the HTL specification here If Java support is needed in the HTL, the recommended solution is to use the Sling Models and the HTL Use-API. See details: use block statement Use-API Sling Models Component renderer script in the WebSight Resource Browser. Template Component template is a resource that gets copied when creating a new component instance and adding it to a page. In other words, it is the initial content of the component. It is used to set default values or prepare necessary content structure. It could also be used to save work during content authoring. The component template resource is a component definition sub-node with the name template . The template resource is optional. If it's not present, a new empty node will be created. Component template resources structure (view from the WebSight Resource Browser tool). Component instance added to the page content initialized from template (view from the WebSight Resource Browser tool). Edit configuration A component may provide an optional resource named editConfig providing configuration customizing component behavior in the Page editor . Reload on update Edit config property named reloadOnUpdate defines what should be refreshed on the component update, for example after editing. Options: self - default behaviour - only updated component is refreshed parent - parent component is refreshed page - edited page is refreshed browser - reload of the Editor in the browser Example 'editConfig' with 'reloadOnUpdate' property { \"reloadOnUpdate\" : \"page\" } Hide actions Edit config property named hideActions can provide an array of Page editor actions names (see list of the component actions with names in the Page editor ) that should not be available for the component. Example 'editConfig' with 'hideActions' property { \"hideActions\" : [ \"edit-properties\" , \"delete\" ] } Default action Edit config property named defaultAction can provide a name of a Page editor action (see list of the component actions with names in the Page editor ) that should be executed if the author double-clicks on the component. If not provided, the inline-editing action (see Inline editing ) is executed if the component is configured to support it, otherwise the edit-properties action is executed if the component has a dialog configuration (see Dialogs ).

Example component dialog resources in the WebSight Resource Browser. Because the dialog is defined, the edit action in the editor allows you to open the dialog as a set value of the text field. The property value is set on the content node of this Say Hello component instance at the helloText property (according to the name property value at the text field node in the dialog definition): And now the component renderer script will display the property value instead of fallback text: Let's explore all the options and details of the component definition.","title":"Simple component definition example"},{"location":"docs/developers/components/#component-definition-properties","text":"The component definition is a Sling Resource with resource type ws:Component . Use the following resource properties to define the component: Component property Required Value Description sling:resourceType Yes ws:Component Defines that this resource is a component definition. sling:resourceSuperType No super resource type Set this property to make your component extend another component. That way, the extended component elements can be reused in the extending components. Example value: wcm/core/components/page title Yes string Component name visible in UI. Example value: Title group Yes string Component group name. Allows us to present related components in the UI. Used while defining allowedComponents. Use the value .hidden to make the component definition not visible in the UI. Example value: General isContainer No boolean, false by default Defines the component as a container. Containers are components that contain child components that can be added, removed and reordered using the authoring interface. If true, the allowedComponents property is required too. allowedComponents No* array of strings. Values are absolute component paths and group names. No default value; by default nothing is allowed. Array listing allowed child component absolute paths or groups that can be added to the container. *Required if isContainer=\u201dtrue\u201d . Example value: [ \"/apps/my-app/components/component1\", \"/apps/my-app/components/component2\", \"Content\", \"Blog\" ] isLayout No boolean, false by default Defines the component as a layout component. Layout components are displayed in a separate section in the WebSight CMS pages editor from components that are not layout components. It\u2019s up to the component developer to set isLayout=true , but the guideline is to use it for components that: - are used to define page layout - must contain other components to be usable - contain no logic (other than logic related to layout calculation) - interact only on page resize (no other \u201cuser actions\u201d allowed) - have no visible UI elements (like texts) Examples of Layouts: - 2-column container - 1-column container - Section with title, image, text and CTA (container including components) Example of components that are not Layouts: - image, title or CTA, all of which have visible UI elements (like texts) - logo cloud, which contain very specific CSS logic and should not be used to create generic page layouts) - Accordion, which contains logic not related to layout calculation - Image gallery, which contains logic not related to layout calculation instanceResourceType No resource type that will be set on created component instance If this property is not set, the resource type of every created component instance node will be set to a value resolved from the component definition resource path. If set, then this property value will be used instead. This allows multiple components definitions, which will result with the same resource type used for created component instances. It could be used to deliver components (or layout components) with different initial content. For example: The Section layout component contains an embedded Title component and is a container that renders child components below the Title . If the authoring section with four columns needs to be created, then the Section component needs to be added with four containers inside that are configured to be displayed as columns. If this page layout is commonly used during content authoring then a new layout component could be implemented to simplify the process. A Section with four columns layout component could be added. The instanceResourceType property should be set to the Section component resource type and initial content should provide the same structure as was created manually before (a section plus four configured child containers). This way, after dropping Section with four columns on the page, the commonly used content structure will be ready to use immediately.

They can use these components to build dialogs for submitting data that is saved in content resources. WebSight CMS delivers a set of ready-to-use components. These are detailed in the subsections of this documentation page. Rendering dialogs In this documentation, we present dialogs configurations in a modal, which is the default dialog rendering. However, dialogs can be rendered in other ways, for example as a side panel . Dialog structure Each dialog can be built using two element types: containers - used to achieve proper structure of fields in a dialog. Examples: container, tab, tabs fields - used to input values via dialogs. Examples: textfield, numberfield, pathPicker An example dialog structure definition: { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/dialog\" , \"tabs\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/tabs\" , \"properties\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/tab\" , \"label\" : \"Properties\" , \"title\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/textfield\" , \"label\" : \"Title\" , \"name\" : \"title\" }, \"description\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext\" , \"label\" : \"Description\" , \"name\" : \"description\" } }, \"advanced\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/tab\" , \"label\" : \"Advanced\" , \"shadows\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/toggle\" , \"name\" : \"shadows\" , \"label\" : \"Use shadows\" }, \"style\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/select\" , \"label\" : \"Style\" , \"name\" : \"style\" , \"primary\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/select/selectitem\" , \"label\" : \"Primary\" , \"value\" : \"primary\" }, \"secondary\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/select/selectitem\" , \"label\" : \"Secondary\" , \"selected\" : true , \"value\" : \"secondary\" }, \"link\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/select/selectitem\" , \"label\" : \"Link\" , \"value\" : \"link\" } } } } } This will result in the following within the UI dialog: Data structure The data structure depends on the name property. In a simple example, a property value is saved directly as a resource property. \"title\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/textfield\" , \"label\" : \"Title\" , \"name\" : \"title\" } In the above example, the title is added directly as a resource property. You can also manipulate data from other resources by using a path in the name property: \"alt\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/textfield\" , \"name\" : \"image/alt\" , \"label\" : \"Alt text\" } In the above example, the alt property is saved as an image property from the header context. You can also manipulate data from other resources using a multifield. The following dialog field name property defines a node, under which we create other resources with properties defined in the multifield property. \"urls\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/multifield\" , \"name\" : \"urls\" , \"label\" : \"Footer URLs\" , \"labelField\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/textfield\" , \"name\" : \"label\" , \"label\" : \"Label\" }, \"addressField\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/pathpicker\" , \"name\" : \"address\" , \"label\" : \"URL\" } } Validation WebSight supports the validation of dialog values on the backend side. If the value is incorrect, it won't be saved and the dialog can't be submitted. The author will see an error message: Custom validator To prepare a custom validator you have to extend pl.ds.websight.dialog.spi.DialogValidator from pl.ds.websight:websight-dialogs-service as an OSGi @Component(service = DialogValidator.class) . You must implement the following methods: boolean supports(Resource resource) - should return whether the dialog resource is supported by this validator. This check will be done for each resource that represents dialog fields String validate(Resource resource, Map<String, Object> propertiesToSave) - should return a validation result as follows: success - return null error - return String with an error message, which will be displayed in the dialog Show/hide dialog fields By default, all dialog components are visible, but you can hide them if you wish. Context To show or hide a particular field depending on dialog context you can use the ws:disallowedContext parameter. The default context value used for dialogs is edit . Depending on dialog usage, different contexts might be used. For example, when creating a page, the 'create' context is used. This way some fields might be disabled during the page creation process. \"ws:disallowedContext\" : [ \"create\" ] To hide an element in dialog, the request from the front-end that fetches it must contain the additional parameter context . If the context value matches one of the ws:dissallowedContext values, then the field won't be rendered. To check request details, refer to the Swagger documentation . Conditions To show or hide a particular field based on other fields' state, you can use a ws:display node. This node should contain children that define the conditions that determine whether the element is displayed. If the component has this child node, it's hidden by default. It must fulfill at least one of the defined conditions to show the component. Each condition should have two properties: sourceName - the name of the component whose value would be checked values - one or more values. At least one of them should match the source field value to fulfill the condition. Example conditions configurations: with single value: \"ws:display\" : { \"condition\" : { \"sourceName\" : \"fieldName\" , \"values\" : \"option1\" } } with multiple values: \"ws:display\" : { \"condition\" : { \"sourceName\" : \"fieldName\" , \"values\" : [ \"option1\" , \"option2\" , \"option3\" ] } } Example dialog definition: { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/dialog\" , \"hideall\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/toggle\" , \"name\" : \"hideall\" , \"label\" : \"Hide all other elements\" }, \"container\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/container\" , \"showrequiredfield\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/toggle\" , \"name\" : \"showrequiredfield\" , \"label\" : \"Show required field\" }, \"requiredfield\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/textfield\" , \"name\" : \"requiredfield\" , \"label\" : \"Required field\" , \"required\" : true , \"ws:display\" : { \"condition\" : { \"sourceName\" : \"showrequiredfield\" , \"values\" : \"true\" } } }, \"ws:display\" : { \"condition\" : { \"sourceName\" : \"hideall\" , \"values\" : \"false\" } } } } Initial dialog state: Checking \"Hide all other elements\" hides the second field. Checking \"Show required field\" shows another field. Default state Some components allow you to define a default state. For exmaple, a checkbox can be checked by default, and selecting it can use the default option. It is important to keep using those components with the same default state that is used in backend models. Example: dialog field definition with h2 selected by default: { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/radio\" , \"name\" : \"headingLevel\" , \"label\" : \"Heading level\" , \"h1\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/radio/option\" , \"label\" : \"H1\" , \"value\" : \"h1\" }, \"h2\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/radio/option\" , \"label\" : \"H2\" , \"selected\" : true , \"value\" : \"h2\" }, \"h3\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/radio/option\" , \"label\" : \"H3\" , \"value\" : \"h3\" } } model class: @Model ( adaptables = Resource . class ) public class TitleComponent { @Inject @Default ( values = \"h2\" ) private String headingLevel ; } You can use Component template to achieve a similar effect, but only if you add a new component. There is no easy solution to update all existing resources, so the initial content is useless if you extend the existing component.

See customization below) The path of the resource that needs to be included. namespace - string (optional) If we include the same component multiple times, then we will have a name conflict. To avoid this, we can set the namespace property. The name properties' values will be prepended by this namespace. For example: if the included component's name property is authorName and we set book1 as the namespace, the name will be book1/authorName when reading and saving the dialog. \"headingLevel\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headinglevel\" , \"namespace\" : \"secondsubtitle\" } Customization Sometimes it is not enough to include other components and use the default settings provided by the included component.

It allows the content authors to build pages using components in a WYSIWYG way. They can work with components on a page using intuitive drag-and-drop functionality and provide content and configuration to the components . Component actions When a component is selected the list of available actions is presented in the toolbar. Action name is the technical identifier used for example in the Edit configuration . List of actions available by default: Title Name Description Edit inline-edit Starts inline editing, see Inline editing Properties edit-properties Opens a dialog to edit a component properties. Copy copy Copies the component. Cut cut Cuts the component. Paste paste Pastes the component after copy or cut. Select parent select-parent Changes active component to the parent component. Delete delete Deletes the component. Technical details Edit Mode Edit mode is used for editing page content. Workspace content presentation Edit mode displays the edited page inside an iframe stretched to match the content height. The iframe is stretched vertically to match the content height to provide a canvas-like experience to content authors. It is accomplished by reacting to content height changes and fixing issues that result from displaying an iframe in this way (like using vh unit). It means the edited page itself is not scrollable, so the content author will not see any changes to the edited page that happen on scroll (e.g. sticky positioning will not work). Workspace Overlays The edited page is (mostly) not altered, all UI is displayed in edit mode directly. All the UI elements of the mode are displayed outside the iframe to increase the separation of the two. We wanted to achieve the highest possible level of sandboxing the edited page. The especially important and technically complex parts of edit mode UI are overlays , like: Component selectors - \"borders\" marking the content of a given component instance, Selected component toolbar - toolbar with actions allowed for a selected component, Placeholders - placeholders generated for components without content. All those items are displayed on top of the iframe containing the edited page. The content author interacts with overlays , not the elements of the edited page. The iframe with overlays on top of it is called workspace . Areas Overlays locations are based on areas , the representation of size and position of the components in the edited page. The areas are calculated based on the edited page elements. Each component has a corresponding area , covering all its DOM elements. To display overlays that are up to date with what is happening on the edited page, it is not enough to calculate areas once, on the iframe load, nor it is enough to recalculate them on actions (like adding, deleting and editing component ). We are observing all DOM elements inside the iframe to react to size and position changes of components and recalculating the areas every time. It causes the overlays to display correctly in cases like: asynchronous loading of resources (like images and videos), dynamic changes using JavaScript scripts, dynamic changes using CSS animations. Preview mode Preview mode displays the edited page inside an iframe as well, but this time the iframe\u2019s height adjusts to available space in the page editor . This way the iframe is displayed in a more \"natural\" way, similar to how the published page is displayed in browser window. The iframe is scrollable, meaning it will react to scroll events (e.g. support sticky elements). It is also handling vh unit properly.","title":"Page Editor"},{"location":"docs/developers/page-editor/#page-editor","text":"","title":"Page Editor"},{"location":"docs/developers/page-editor/#overview","text":"Page Editor is a core part of WebSight CMS and an essential tool for content authors.

The Side Panel is more suitable for quick edits to be previewed right away on the page content, such as changing a font size, button variant, or card style, unlike the modal where the focus is on editing the complete configuration of the component at once. Configuration By default, the component's dialog configuration will be used for both the side panel and the dialog. It means that all components support the side panel right away. Since their purposes are different, it is possible to differentiate between the fields & layout for the regular modal and the side panel. The configuration allows developers to decide field-by-field if it should appear in both or only in one of the two contexts. The mechanism used to achieve that is the ws:disallowedContext parameter (see more details about the mechanism here ). The two contexts that can be disabled are edit:dialog and edit:panel . Example 1 In this example, we're showcasing how to hide a select on the dialog and a toggle on the side panel. { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/dialog\" , \"title\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/textfield\" , \"name\" : \"title\" , \"label\" : \"Title\" }, \"shadows\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/toggle\" , \"name\" : \"shadows\" , \"label\" : \"Use shadows\" , \"ws:disallowedContext\" : [ \"edit:panel\" ] }, \"style\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/select\" , \"label\" : \"Style\" , \"name\" : \"style\" , \"ws:disallowedContext\" : [ \"edit:dialog\" ], \"primary\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/select/selectitem\" , \"label\" : \"Primary\" , \"value\" : \"primary\" }, \"secondary\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/select/selectitem\" , \"label\" : \"Secondary\" , \"selected\" : true , \"value\" : \"secondary\" } } } Result Example 2 In this example, we're defining a completely separate layout and order for the two ways of editing to achieve an even better authoring experience. To accomplish this, we create a configuration of three tabs. The first two will only appear on the modal, while the third one will only appear on the side panel. The third tab includes all three fields that are available on the other two tabs. It allows the author to edit all the properties in the side panel in one tab but defines separation for the fields on the modal. { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/dialog\" , \"tabs\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/tabs\" , \"properties\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/tab\" , \"label\" : \"Properties\" , \"ws:disallowedContext\" : [ \"edit:panel\" ], \"headingLevel\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headinglevel\" }, \"headingSize\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" } }, \"styles\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/tab\" , \"label\" : \"Styles\" , \"ws:disallowedContext\" : [ \"edit:panel\" ], \"styleVariant\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/stylevariant\" } }, \"sidepanel\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/tab\" , \"label\" : \"Properties\" , \"ws:disallowedContext\" : [ \"edit:dialog\" ], \"headingLevel\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headinglevel\" }, \"headingSize\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" }, \"styleVariant\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/stylevariant\" } } } } Result Saving and error handling The saving of the fields works automatically. There is no need to press a submit button. Some field values are changed with a mouse click, for example, the toggle. The side panel saves them immediately, and the results are visible almost instantly. Other fields, for example, the text field or the path picker, require typing a new value. It is stored when an author stops typing (debounce manner). The approach reduces the number of content updates that would cause page flickering. No matter if errors happen during the regular editing experience (e.g. validations) or are caused by technical problems, they need to be handled. In case of any errors during saving, the side panel resets the modified field to the latest stable state (either the initial one or the last successfully saved one). This is to ensure that the author always sees valid and up-to-date information on the side panel. Validations Since the purpose of the side panel is to provide a lightweight solution for simple editing, it has some limitations compared to the regular modal. Fields that are validated are not recommended to be displayed and edited on the side panel. Editing such fields with a value that breaks a validation rule will result in an error message and the field will be reset (as described above).","title":"Side Panel"},{"location":"docs/developers/page-editor/side-panel/#side-panel","text":"","title":"Side Panel"},{"location":"docs/developers/page-editor/side-panel/#overview","text":"The Side Panel is a part of the Page editor and allows editing the properties of the selected component.

Before you complete this guide, we recommend completing the basic quick start guide first so that you understand basic WebSight CMS concepts. For demonstration purposes, this guide uses a sample component library, Howlite , and a demo site project, Luna . For the sake of simplicity, we overrode the Title component included in the Howlite collection in advance and preconfigured the Luna Title component inside the demo project. Your task in completing this guide is to update the Luna Title component and extend existing functionality and tests. The sections below explain more detail. Important notice All scripts presented below are designed for Linux-based platforms. If you are a Windows user, please install and configure Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to use this guide. Part A: Prerequisites Install AdoptOpenJDK 17 with 'x64/aarch64' architecture (on macOS use brew install openjdk@17 ): Install Node.js and NPM Install Docker Desktop . Install Git Part B: Setup local environment First, clone the Luna repository and build it within your local environment using the following commands: git clone https://github.com/websight-io/starter.git cd starter ./mvnw clean install -P e2e Then, start a Docker environment. docker compose -f environment/local/docker-compose.yml up -d Congratulations! Your local environment is now ready. To view it, open http://localhost:8080/ in a Web browser and log in using the credentials wsadmin / wsadmin . Part C: Changing component Hint If you need help navigating inside WebSight, see the basic getting started guide for details. Business requirement Let's imagine the following scenario: A page owner wants you to update the title of the page that describes the company's new Grand Luxor Jewelry Collection. To fulfill this request, you are asked to keep the collection name on one line and decrease the font size for the text Meet our . The expected result is presented below. Technical scope To do this, you need to extend the Title component included in the Howlite library. Before doing that, let's check the orginal component first to identify the scope of changes. Run WebSight, open the Luna space and edit the home page. Find the Title component that contains the text Meet our New Grand Luxor Jewelry Collection and edit its properties on the sidepanel. Enable the Overline text option, move Meet our from Heading text to Overline text . As you can see, the result comes close to meeting the expectation, but the font size of the overline text is too small. You could prepare a new version of the Title component with a different font size for the overline text. However, this is not a flexible solution. Creating an additional input field to define the font size for the overline text is a better option. Info For simplicity, we overrode the original component in advance and prepared the Luna Title component. It is a part of the demo site project, but it is just a placeholder. It works exactly as the Title . The following sections guide you on how to implement the change. Component update Your task is to enable setup of the overline font size. To start, first you need to add a new field, overlineSize , to the model class LunaTitleComponent.java . Let's define a default size hl-title__heading--size-5 according to the received design as well. The following Java code will do this: application/backend/src/main/java/pl/ds/luna/compoennts/models/LunaTitleComponent.java package pl.ds.luna.components.models ; import javax.inject.Inject ; import org.apache.sling.api.resource.Resource ; import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.Default ; import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.Model ; import pl.ds.howlite.components.models.TitleComponent ; @Model ( adaptables = Resource . class ) public class LunaTitleComponent extends TitleComponent { @Inject @Default ( values = { \"hl-title__heading--size-5\" }) private String overlineSize ; public String getOverlineSize (){ return overlineSize ; } } Next, you need to update the component HTML template. The original one defines the CSS class that determines the font size as hl-title__heading--size-6 . < h6 class = \"hl-title__heading hl-title__heading--size-6\" data-testid = \"overline\" > ${model.subtitle} </ h6 > Because you updated the model class, you can use its property now. application/backend/src/main/resources/apps/luna/components/lunatitle/lunatitle.html < h6 class = \"hl-title__heading ${model.overlineSize}\" data-testid = \"overline\" > ${model.subtitle} </ h6 > The last step is to add the field to the dialog used by authors. They need it to define component properties in the page editor. To enable this, you have to override the dialog definition from Howlite. Do so by creating a new dialog directory and put .content.json file inside. application/backend/src/main/resources/apps/luna/components/lunatitle/dialog/.content.json { \"tabs\" : { \"generalTab\" : { \"container\" : { \"overlineSize\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"sling:orderBefore\" : \"overline\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" , \"include\" : { \"sling:resourceSuperType\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" , \"label\" : \"Overline size\" , \"name\" : \"overlineSize\" , \"description\" : \"Changes font size\" , \"s\" : { \"selected\" : true }, \"m\" : { \"selected\" : false } } } } } } } The above definition specifies the new overlineSize field. It is placed before the overline field and uses a heading size definition from Howlite, but with small size selected by default. Apply changes Run the following command to apply the changes to your local environment. ./mvnw -f application/backend/pom.xml clean install -P autoInstallBundle Part D: Functional tests Run functional tests We continuously improve WebSight CMS by adding new features, improving the UX, and fixing bugs. Thus, we need confidence that changes don't lead to any regression on websites. To provide this confidence, we use Cypress to enable automated testing of components. This approach enables us to spend less time on manual testing and regression fixes. We can focus on developing new features and improvements instead. To demonstrate automated functional testing, we prepared two sample functional tests for the Luna Title component. They are executed during the Maven build process. You can run them using npm on your local environment as well. However, you have to add test content before running the tests. Use the following script to set this up: ./mvnw -f tests/content/pom.xml clean install -P autoInstallPackage Now, you can run the tests using the following command: npm run-script test --prefix tests/end-to-end If you execute the tests, they will detect your changes for the Luna Title and fail. You should get the following results: Running: lunatitle.cy.ts (1 of 1) Luna Title component 1) renders correctly in preview mode 2) renders correctly in edit mode 0 passing (8s) 2 failing 1) Luna Title component renders correctly in preview mode: AssertionError: expected '<h6.hl-title__heading.hl-title__heading--size-5>' to have CSS property 'font-size' with the value '20px', but the value was '25.008px' + expected - actual -'25.008px' +'20px' ... 2) Luna Title component renders correctly in edit mode: Timed out retrying after 4000ms + expected - actual { 'sling:resourceType': 'luna/components/lunatitle', title: 'New heading', showSubtitle: 'true', - overlineSize: 'hl-title__heading--size-5', subtitle: 'New overline text', 'jcr:primaryType': 'nt:unstructured', headingLevel: 'h1', headingSize: 'hl-title__heading--size-2' } When a functional test fails, you should check why. It is expected in this case, as you implemented new requirements. Firstly, you updated the default font size of the overline component (to ensure consistency with the design). Secondly, you added a new property to the dialog for the component. The tests recognized both changes, and you should adjust them as well. The following section explains how to do so. Hint A best practice is to start by changing a test so that it fails until you've made desired changes. Then, apply your changes so that the test passes. Update functional tests When functional tests fail due to changes, you should adjust them. They are placed in file tests/end-to-end/tests/lunatitle.cy.ts . The first test checks the font size for the overline text. There are two component instances validated. Thus, you need to update assertions for both of them as follows. cy . getByTestId ( 'component_title1' ) . findByTestId ( 'overline' ) . should ( 'have.css' , \"font-size\" , \"25.008px\" ) . should ( 'have.text' , 'Additional overline text filled' ) cy . getByTestId ( 'component_title2' ) . findByTestId ( 'overline' ) . should ( 'have.css' , \"font-size\" , \"25.008px\" ) . should ( 'have.text' , 'Resized to 6 cols on L breakpoint' ) The second test validates the dialog for the component. Update the test to recognize the new input field. cy . request ( '/content/starter-test/pages/LunaTitle/jcr:content/rootcontainer/maincontainer/pagesection/title.json' ) . its ( 'body' ) . should ( 'deep.eq' , { 'sling:resourceType' : 'luna/components/lunatitle' , title : 'New heading' , showSubtitle : 'true' , overlineSize : 'hl-title__heading--size-5' , subtitle : 'New overline text' , 'jcr:primaryType' : 'nt:unstructured' , headingLevel : 'h1' , headingSize : 'hl-title__heading--size-2' }); Run functional tests again Now, you can execute the updated functional tests: ./mvnw -f tests/content/pom.xml clean install -P autoInstallPackage npm run-script test --prefix tests/end-to-end Both tests should pass this time. You should receive a report like the one below. Running: lunatitle.cy.ts (1 of 1) Luna Title component \u2713 renders correctly in preview mode (1030ms) \u2713 renders correctly in edit mode (2774ms) 2 passing (4s) Congratulations! You updated the component, and it passed tests. Part E: Use the new component Hint If you need help to navigate inside WebSight, see the general getting started for details. The page owner can use the updated component now. Let's verify by checking it out in the admin interface. Switch to WebSight CMS, open the Luna space, and edit the home page. Find the Title with text Meet our New Grand Luxor Jewelry Collection . Then, find the Luna Title in the component tree on the left.

To fulfill this request, you are asked to keep the collection name on one line and decrease the font size for the text Meet our . The expected result is presented below.","title":"Business requirement"},{"location":"docs/developers/quick-start/#technical-scope","text":"To do this, you need to extend the Title component included in the Howlite library. Before doing that, let's check the orginal component first to identify the scope of changes. Run WebSight, open the Luna space and edit the home page. Find the Title component that contains the text Meet our New Grand Luxor Jewelry Collection and edit its properties on the sidepanel. Enable the Overline text option, move Meet our from Heading text to Overline text . As you can see, the result comes close to meeting the expectation, but the font size of the overline text is too small. You could prepare a new version of the Title component with a different font size for the overline text. However, this is not a flexible solution. Creating an additional input field to define the font size for the overline text is a better option. Info For simplicity, we overrode the original component in advance and prepared the Luna Title component. It is a part of the demo site project, but it is just a placeholder. It works exactly as the Title . The following sections guide you on how to implement the change.","title":"Technical scope"},{"location":"docs/developers/quick-start/#component-update","text":"Your task is to enable setup of the overline font size. To start, first you need to add a new field, overlineSize , to the model class LunaTitleComponent.java . Let's define a default size hl-title__heading--size-5 according to the received design as well. The following Java code will do this: application/backend/src/main/java/pl/ds/luna/compoennts/models/LunaTitleComponent.java package pl.ds.luna.components.models ; import javax.inject.Inject ; import org.apache.sling.api.resource.Resource ; import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.Default ; import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.Model ; import pl.ds.howlite.components.models.TitleComponent ; @Model ( adaptables = Resource . class ) public class LunaTitleComponent extends TitleComponent { @Inject @Default ( values = { \"hl-title__heading--size-5\" }) private String overlineSize ; public String getOverlineSize (){ return overlineSize ; } } Next, you need to update the component HTML template. The original one defines the CSS class that determines the font size as hl-title__heading--size-6 . < h6 class = \"hl-title__heading hl-title__heading--size-6\" data-testid = \"overline\" > ${model.subtitle} </ h6 > Because you updated the model class, you can use its property now. application/backend/src/main/resources/apps/luna/components/lunatitle/lunatitle.html < h6 class = \"hl-title__heading ${model.overlineSize}\" data-testid = \"overline\" > ${model.subtitle} </ h6 > The last step is to add the field to the dialog used by authors. They need it to define component properties in the page editor. To enable this, you have to override the dialog definition from Howlite. Do so by creating a new dialog directory and put .content.json file inside. application/backend/src/main/resources/apps/luna/components/lunatitle/dialog/.content.json { \"tabs\" : { \"generalTab\" : { \"container\" : { \"overlineSize\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"sling:orderBefore\" : \"overline\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" , \"include\" : { \"sling:resourceSuperType\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" , \"label\" : \"Overline size\" , \"name\" : \"overlineSize\" , \"description\" : \"Changes font size\" , \"s\" : { \"selected\" : true }, \"m\" : { \"selected\" : false } } } } } } } The above definition specifies the new overlineSize field. It is placed before the overline field and uses a heading size definition from Howlite, but with small size selected by default.","title":"Component update"},{"location":"docs/developers/quick-start/#apply-changes","text":"Run the following command to apply the changes to your local environment. ./mvnw -f application/backend/pom.xml clean install -P autoInstallBundle","title":"Apply changes"},{"location":"docs/developers/quick-start/#part-d-functional-tests","text":"","title":"Part D: Functional tests"},{"location":"docs/developers/quick-start/#run-functional-tests","text":"We continuously improve WebSight CMS by adding new features, improving the UX, and fixing bugs. Thus, we need confidence that changes don't lead to any regression on websites. To provide this confidence, we use Cypress to enable automated testing of components. This approach enables us to spend less time on manual testing and regression fixes. We can focus on developing new features and improvements instead. To demonstrate automated functional testing, we prepared two sample functional tests for the Luna Title component. They are executed during the Maven build process. You can run them using npm on your local environment as well. However, you have to add test content before running the tests. Use the following script to set this up: ./mvnw -f tests/content/pom.xml clean install -P autoInstallPackage Now, you can run the tests using the following command: npm run-script test --prefix tests/end-to-end If you execute the tests, they will detect your changes for the Luna Title and fail. You should get the following results: Running: lunatitle.cy.ts (1 of 1) Luna Title component 1) renders correctly in preview mode 2) renders correctly in edit mode 0 passing (8s) 2 failing 1) Luna Title component renders correctly in preview mode: AssertionError: expected '<h6.hl-title__heading.hl-title__heading--size-5>' to have CSS property 'font-size' with the value '20px', but the value was '25.008px' + expected - actual -'25.008px' +'20px' ... 2) Luna Title component renders correctly in edit mode: Timed out retrying after 4000ms + expected - actual { 'sling:resourceType': 'luna/components/lunatitle', title: 'New heading', showSubtitle: 'true', - overlineSize: 'hl-title__heading--size-5', subtitle: 'New overline text', 'jcr:primaryType': 'nt:unstructured', headingLevel: 'h1', headingSize: 'hl-title__heading--size-2' } When a functional test fails, you should check why. It is expected in this case, as you implemented new requirements. Firstly, you updated the default font size of the overline component (to ensure consistency with the design). Secondly, you added a new property to the dialog for the component. The tests recognized both changes, and you should adjust them as well. The following section explains how to do so.

It explains how to configure, build and run a new project using Maven Archetype and Docker. It also describes the contents of the project build and runtime files. Although the specific contents of your project may vary depending on your needs, the sample project described on this page is a useful starting-point for running Web applications using WebSight CMS. Prerequisites To create and run a project, you will need Java 17 or later, Maven 3.8.5 or later and Docker Desktop . You can check your Java version in most environments with: java -version openjdk 17.0.2 2022-01-18 OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.2+8 (build 17.0.2+8) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.2+8 (build 17.0.2+8, mixed mode) Check your Maven version with: mvn --version Apache Maven 3.8.5 (3599d3414f046de2324203b78ddcf9b5e4388aa0) Check your Docker installation by running: docker --version Docker version 20.10.14 Generate a project To create a new project, first open a command prompt and cd to the directory where you want to store your project. Next, use a Maven command to create your project, being sure to declare the desired parameters properly. Use the groupId , artifactId , and version parameters to declare Maven artifacts for your project. Use projectName , projectId and package parameters to define technical requirements (such as application resources paths and Docker image names) and the root package for Java code. Use the archetypeVersion parameter to set the archetype version you want to use. You can check the latest version here . Use the cmsVersion parameter to specify the WebSight CMS version that the project should use. Check the WebSight Release Notes to find the latest available version. Example command: mvn archetype:generate \\ -DarchetypeGroupId=pl.ds.websight \\ -DarchetypeArtifactId=websight-cms-ce-project-archetype \\ -DarchetypeVersion=1.6 \\ -DgroupId=my.groupId \\ -DartifactId=my-artifactId \\ -Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT \\ -DprojectName=\"Example Project\" \\ -DprojectId=example-project \\ -Dpackage=com.example.project \\ -DcmsVersion=1.13.0 The above command creates a project with the following structure: . \u2514\u2500\u2500 my-artifactId \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 application \u251c\u2500\u2500 content \u251c\u2500\u2500 distribution \u251c\u2500\u2500 environment \u251c\u2500\u2500 pom.xml \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests Project structure The contents of the project structure we generated above are an example of what you'd typically include when creating a project for a Web application using WebSight CMS.

The distribution module is responsible for bundling the application based on the configurations and WebSight CMS modules using Sling Feature Model . It also prepares the required Docker images to run the complete stack. The finalized project build artifacts are immutable Docker images that can be run on local, test, and production environments. Environment-specific configurations can be implemented by injecting system variables. Info It is possible to deploy application modules to running containers without rebuilding the Docker images, but the changes will be lost after each container restart and can be used only for local development. The distribution delivers two Docker images: CMS - Image that bundles WebSight CMS with your application Nginx - An HTTP server with your project's configuration A third container runs MongoDB as a default data store for Jackrabbit OAK (the persistence layer used by WebSight CMS). The data store stores content such as pages or assets managed by the CMS. We use Docker Compose to orchestrate containers during local setup. See the environment/local module for details.

The local instance serves as a testing instance where you can check out our demo site Luna . You can also use Howlite , our example components library, to create or update pages within the local instance. This guide is a starting-point for developing custom components for WebSight CMS. After you've mastered the concepts explained on this page, you can move onto our quick start for developers for a deeper dive into components development for WebSight CMS. Prerequisites Before going any further, please ensure you have Docker Desktop installed and launched on your machine. Docker Desktop supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. Part A: Run a local instance using Docker Quick setup with curl If you have curl installed, you can set up the local environment using the following command. Then, you can go directly to Part B below. curl https://www.websight.io/scripts/get.sh | sh If this method doesn't work for you, following steps 1 and 2 below to set up the Docker instance manually. 1. Create Docker Compose manifest Paste the content below into a text editor and save it as a file on your hard drive. Name the file docker-compose.yml . docker-compose.yml version : \"3.9\" services : cms : image : public.ecr.aws/ds/websight-cms-starter:1.13.0 ports : - \"8080:8080\" environment : WS_ADMIN_USERNAME : \"wsadmin\" MONGODB_HOST : \"mongo\" MONGODB_PORT : 27017 LEASE_CHECK_MODE : \"LENIENT\" volumes : - cms_logs:/websight/logs - site_repository:/websight/docroot depends_on : - mongo nginx : image : public.ecr.aws/ds/websight-nginx-starter:1.13.0 ports : - \"80:80\" volumes : - site_repository:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro mongo : image : mongo:4.4.6 environment : - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=mongoadmin - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=mongoadmin volumes : - mongo_repository:/data/db volumes : cms_logs : mongo_repository : site_repository : Tip Default passwords are stored in secret files. You can find details about how to change them here . 2. Run the local instance Open the terminal, navigate to the location where you saved your docker-compose.yml file and run the following command: docker compose up A fresh WebSight instance will start within a couple of seconds. After it launches, you can open a Web browser to the URL http://localhost:8080/ to view the WebSight admin panel. Log in with wsadmin username and wsadmin as the password. Tip To turn off the local environment, use the ctrl + c key combination in the terminal that you used to launch your Docker instance. You can restart the instance by repeating the steps you used to launch it initially. Part B: Publish demo site At this point, your local environment is running, but you still need to publish the demo site that is included in the distribution. Do this by following the steps below. 1. Open the Websight admin panel In the local instance, the WebSight admin panel is accessible by navigating to http://localhost:8080/ in a Web browser. Log in with wsadmin username and wsadmin as the password. 2. Select space for the demo site We use Spaces to organise content. In the WebSight admin panel, open the space for the demo site Luna - custom code . 3. Publish assets and the demo site Open the list of Assets using the left sidebar. Select the folder images and then click Publish . Open the list of Pages using the left sidebar. Select all pages and click Publish . 4. View the demo site Congratulations! The demo site is now available by navigating to http://luna.127.0.0.1.nip.io/ in a Web browser. Additional sample sites The distribution contains other demo sites. We used nip.io to support their preview in a browser (having just one local instance of WebSight CMS). After assets and pages publication, they are available at: http://bulma-personal-template.127.0.0.1.nip.io/ Bulma - personal template http://luna-low-code.127.0.0.1.nip.io/ Luna - low code http://luna-no-code.127.0.0.1.nip.io/ Luna - no code Part C: Update a page Now that your local demo site is published, you can experiment with making basic changes to pages. As an example, the following steps show how to update the home page for the demo site that is built into WebSight. 1. Open the Websight admin panel The WebSight admin panel runs at http://localhost:8080/ . Log in with wsadmin username and wsadmin as the password. 2. Select space for the demo site We use Spaces to organise content. Please open the space for the demo site Luna - custom code . 3. Edit the home page Use the Pencil icon to open the Page editor for the home page. Scroll down the content to the section Custom Made Engagement Rings . Find the Rich text editor on the tab Components and use the drag-and-drop feature to place it just below the section title. Click on the new component to check its properties on the side panel on the right. Copy & paste the following text into the Text field on the General tab. Every couple is unique and we want to deliver an engagement ring that is unique too \u2013 taking the tastes of the couple into account. We love having couples visit the store and work with them to create a unique custom engagement ring according to their tastes. 4. Publish changes At this point, you've updated the page. However, unpublished changes are not visible on the site yet. To apply them, open the dropdown in the right corner of the admin interface and select action Publish . 5. View the updated page Congratulations! Your changes should be visible now at http://luna.127.0.0.1.nip.io/ . Next steps This page demonstrated the basics of editing pages with WebSight CMS.
