Defining quality, agreeing on KPIs and planning subsequent steps is a thing. So is having an efficient QA process that helps to achieve it (not block the team from reaching their goals nor demotivate them). It is even more demanding to make the whole development team really care about the quality and make each member feel responsible for it when we move from quality assurance to quality assistance and want to share some of typical QA duties between each team member. So is it possible to have the whole team (not a single quality hero) that ensures the manufactured product meets requirements and keeps guard over quality standards? How and when we do it in our project? How we care about the quality We want to create a new and cutting-edge product. That\u2019s something we strongly believe in but apart from the final effect that, we hope, will positively struck our clients, it is also a kind of innovative approach to our every day work. How we do this? Once we agreed on the main purpose of the product (what it should do and how) we also started our discussion about what the quality means to us and how we are going to make sure that we build a high quality product. Next step was to start creating a QA plan and QA process that would evolve and adapt in time but would also help us to take care about quality from the very beginning. Putting there main ideas like the definition of the quality, and what we should do and how we should work to be able to say that our product meets quality requirements was our main objective here but apart from it we also needed to think how to engage everyone from the team in the process to let this really happen. Working on definition at the same time having quality in the back of our mind was the first step to do at this stage but we wanted to do more. Apart from delivering units and integration, code-reviews and cross-testing (which we actually try to facilitate by experimenting with extreme programming techniques like pair-programming and making the whole process continuous), we decided to create a suite of automated functional checks with Cypress.io that we could make use of to regression test our product at various stages. So we have started with applying it to check each PR. Thanks to the architecture approach that we have adopted, we work with small, separate limited liability modules, which allows for thorough tests in isolation - in other words, a single PR can be deployed to a dedicated environment where it can be tested first. As a result we don't need to run full regression tests against everything we release each time, which in turn accelerates our software development lifecycle. What is more, we can use automated functional checks when launching a new environment and/or as a nightly regression suite against the latest version of the application. Well, it is still worth mentioning that it is a part of our pipeline to automatically, efficiently and reliably build and deploy code. Here what we mean by saying \u2018reliably\u2019 is that whenever a given release causes any failures it is rejected until any discovered issue has been analyzed and resolved. So we not only think about the future and do our best to plan quality around it but we are also reactive and address issues we come across in our everyday work. This suite of automated checks is also a part of the code we are going to share with our clients and community allowing them to quickly check if their deployments were successful and/or the product still works once they expanded it by adding new features or components. When we start to care about quality Let\u2019s get back to our definition for a while. That is the moment we, apart from focusing on strictly business requirements, plan other activities, including automated checks. Referring to our still evolving DoR (Definition of Ready) and DoD (Definition of Done) where we have added automated functional checks as a part of requirements we hold each team member working on a given feature responsible for creating automated checks that will allow us to regression test this feature later on, according to our processes. As a result we do not need a dedicated role of a quality assurance engineer nor automation engineer that would be responsible for creating and maintaining automated checks. We invest some effort at the beginning but it always pays back, as having automated checks automatically running as a part of the CI process allows us to ultimately save much time needed to re-check feature by feature later. Summary Quality assurance should be a high priority when we think of building a successful product. Building an effective process around it helps much when it starts from the very beginning and lasts until its end. However, delivering quality is a healthy procedure only when there is the whole development team engaged in it, not a single role. And of course, it is always more effective when an implemented, tested and deployed feature can be checked automatically within a few seconds as a part of the CI process instead of struggling to find a person and time for reproducing repeatable regression test cases again and again.","title":"Achieving quality with no dedicated QA Engineers"},{"location":"blog/2022/achieving-quality-with-no-dedicated-qa-engineers/#how-we-care-about-the-quality","text":"We want to create a new and cutting-edge product.

Some developers would say 'Yes' and their solutions would work... sometimes. I've decided to write a post about it because I often see people misunderstand Sling abstraction in relation to JCR. WebSight Resource Browser with non-JCR Resources on WebSight Community Edition When I started to learn AEM more than 10 years ago, my favorite tool was CRXDE. I used it together with a web browser to observe how changes made in a repository affect the resource tree and the site. Once you are familiar with CRXDE, you can start using Maven and a content-package plugin to produce FileVault packages which can be installed on AEM. Such packages may contain code, configurations, users, permissions, and content. Once a package is installed, you can view it in the resource tree. Changes can be previewed in a web browser by entering a resource path with an extension (a default Sling GET servlet offers JSON, text, and XML renderers mapped to .json, .txt, and .xml extensions respectively). So what seems to be the problem here? From my experience, the main issue is the lack of visibility of resources other than JCR in the standard AEM tooling. You've probably heard the golden rule of the Sling community - \"Everything is a Resource\" a million times. The visible resources are sites, pages, assets, users, components, configurations, and bundles... and all are in JCR. Hence it is natural to conclude that a Sling Resource is a JCR Node, well it is a wrong conclusion. At Dynamic Solutions, we work on a generic Sling Resource Browser as a part of WebSight Community Edition (formerly part of WebSight.Admin tools suite). Apart from the support for reading/writing the JCR Resources, it allows users to browse ALL registered resources. Sling comes with 3, WebSight with 4 and AEM with 9 Out Of the Box Resource Providers. For the purpose of this blog post, I've installed WebSight Resource Browser on AEM 6.5 to demonstrate available providers. Note that we don't maintain AEM compatible distribution of WebSight.Admin tools anymore. Sites, pages, DAM, data, users, components, configurations, and bundles come from JCR, but there are others like servlets, scripts, Bundle Resources, File Resources, and Cloud Resources we should know about. JCR is considered to be the most important resource provider. However, in theory, it's possible to run and work on Sling without JCR at all, simply by using other available resource providers. Resources come in a variety of 'shapes and forms', some resource types are read-only, some allow writing data and some allow creating nodes. Our WebSight Resource Browser supports all resource types with a special extension to enable provider-specific features (therefore with full JCR support). OK, so how do I work with resources? First of all, start using them. Whenever you need to integrate Sling with an external system or need to access a custom resource, implementing your own resource provider may be a proper approach. Furthermore, there already exist implementations of some custom resource providers: NoSQL Resource Providers Filesystem Resource Provider Using extended/custom resource providers is definitely the most elegant way of working with resources in a \"Sling way\" (once again - Everything is a Resource). Secondly, it's important to follow certain rules during our day-to-day work: Use Sling Resource API instead of the JCR API, always when possible. The entire hierarchy would be: CMS API > Sling API > JCR API > OAK API, however, it is a subject for a separate post. Encapsulate usage of the JCR API by creating OSGi services and keep them separated from the generic Sling-based code. Use the JCR API only if you need to access JCR-specific features, Sling does not abstract, for example, User Management, Version Management, Permission Management, complex Nodes definitions, FileVault, and indices are only available when using JCR or Oak API. Think of the entire pool of resources, not only ones based on JCR. Remember that resource.adaptTo(Node.class) may simply not work. Summary This blog post is about Sling, but the topics raised here are very important while developing and working with other Sling-based platforms like WebSight, AEM, or Peregrine.

However, the city is not something permanent. It is constantly changing within its borders. City planners should replan internal city roads easily, adapting them to new requirements. However, for provincial and municipal roads, all changes should be approved by the provincial executive planners. The same rules are valid in IT. As long as we change our private functions, the impact on the overall system is low. However, by changing module interfaces, we can break other modules. We expect a mechanism to define and constantly validate our national, provincial, city and private application roads. In this article, you will learn how we can benefit from OSGi modularity and Sling Feature Model. OSGi Bundles Components are the main building blocks for OSGi applications. With single annotation, we can make a POJO an OSGi component and let the OSGi manage its lifecycle. However, if we want to reference it within our application, we need to declare it as a service . The OSGI implements a service component model - a declarative model for publishing, finding and binding services. This model assumes that all services can expose their functionalities to others. A service implements some API and registers itself in the OSGi service registry. This way, other services can reference other services via APIs, allowing a more dynamic binding. It is how logically we compose the application from small building blocks. On the other hand, we need to group our services into more granular modules, called bundles. A bundle is an identifiable module containing such details as requirements and capabilities - so we initially declare what we need and offer from/to the other registered OSGi bundles. Instead of saying that services communicate with other services, we can say that bundles communicate and collaborate using services. It means that the client of a service is always a bundle. A bundle may register/use zero or more services. While services are the main building blocks for OSGi applications, bundles are the main deployment blocks. With services, we can define loosely coupled objects. With bundles, we organize them into modules with an independent development lifecycle. There are obvious benefits of decomposing an application into modules. A good modularization optimizes the impact of expected changes to only a low percentage of the modules. Cohesive modules containing limited sizes are easy to understand and clearly minimize communication between development teams, thus reducing errors. So It is natural for experienced developers to split their code into smaller pieces with well-defined contracts. 7\u00b12 things However, keeping things small comes with a price - with high granularity, we lose the capability of understanding high-level functionalities. This problem is described in Miller's law , known as 7\u00b12 \u2018things\u2019 . It simply says that we humans have limited cognition and our brains can recall only a few \u2018things\u2019 immediately. That is, up to about 3 or 4 \u2018things\u2019 do not require counting. Over the 7\u00b12 limit, we need to chunk . Miller's law says: Chunking is used by the brain's short-term memory as a method for keeping groups of information accessible for easy recall. Our brain is chunking things based on some common characteristics such as a shape or color. In development, chunking appears at the very low level. Objects and packages are higher-level concepts that group underlying code. Packages are organized into modules (bundles). And having in mind such principles as single-responsibility, we try to keep the number of objects per package small, the same with packages per module. With such a definition, we can easily notice that both modularity and chunking should always be applied together, at every abstraction level. Focusing only on modularity can increase the system complexity drastically. Having that in mind there is an open question: how can we apply chunking at the bundles level. Would it be possible to group bundles into higher level \u2018things\u2019, and then once again group these higher level things into more generic ones, and so on? This is exactly what Sling OSGi Feature Model provides. Sling feature model The feature model is an identifiable JSON-based definition containing bundles, OSGi framework properties and configurations. With these, we can easily define more granular functionalities. What is more, features can be declared from scratch or they can use another pre-existing feature as a prototype . It is especially useful to make minor adjustments to an existing feature and use the new feature instead of the original one. For example, we can replace a single bundle or add a bundle with, for example, testing data However, the Sling OSGI Feature Model is more than the declaration. It also supplies a maven plugin with features validation and aggregation capabilities. The tool that checks all features for completeness and correctness is named the Feature Model Analyser . We can ensure that our declared feature model contains all required bundles during the compilation stage. Once we deliver a feature, we can trust that there are no missing imports (requirements) and that all feature bundles are active. However, there is also a tradeoff - a feature model is declared in advance, so a list of bundles must be complete and final . Example It is time for a short example. Our WebSight CMS is composed of features such as a page editor, package and resource managers, groovy console, assets management etc. In some cases, we want to be able to aggregate some features into the bigger one. The admin tools feature is a good example: It aggregates package manager, resource manager and groovy console. This newly defined feature can be easily used by other teams building more custom applications for our clients. While our development team can deliver a new functionality in the page editor feature without worrying about other admin tools, our CI can check either more high level features for correctness and completeness. Higher-level features work like contracts for more granular features. It is the real benefit of chunking. With the above approach, aggregating higher and higher features, we finally declare the top-level feature as an application-level feature . We keep two base WebSight features: one with local filesystem storage and the second with MongoDB. They differ only in the kind of storage. Finally, we see the feature model as a perfect solution for customization. We keep a separate team delivering a demo website with custom components, styling and templates, called Howlite. This team is reusing the application-level WebSight feature and adding only a single Howlite feature. It is the way we want our clients to work with WebSight. Summary In this article, we presented the idea of features - higher-level blocks of functionalities that build modern OSGi applications. WebSight is composed of multiple features, such as a page editor, assets management, and admin tools. In addition, we are using features aggregation as a starting point for building a client-specific application on top of WebSight. And the last thing to add is that developers can still focus only on small single-purpose building blocks - bundles. Features are nothing but groups of bundles and configs with a higher-level purpose and name.","title":"Building OSGi applications with Sling Feature Model"},{"location":"blog/2022/building-osgi-apps-with-sling-feature-model/#osgi-bundles","text":"Components are the main building blocks for OSGi applications.

You can configure the editing options as separate buttons, group them in a dropdown or prepare a dropdown list. Moreover, you can extend the set of existing functionalities and create additional UI components or implement different plugins. Then, you can mix them all and include them in the toolbar to provide new options. WebSight CMS delivers the following UI components for the RTE toolbar: Button with a caption or displayed as an icon (if provided); Button Dropdown that groups several buttons in a dropdown; Dropdown that contains a list of options; Link that opens a dialog for a link setup. The list of available plugin components is as follows: Bold Italic Underline Strikethrough Bullet list Ordered list Paragraph Heading Link Unset link Clear formatting Hard Break Text Align Undo Redo Using RTE as a dialog field RTE is not a stand-alone content editor in WebSight CMS. You need to add it in a dialog definition for a component. Use wcm/dialogs/components/richtext as the resource type. Once completed, you can drag and drop the component on a page, open its dialog and enter the content. /libs/howlite/components/richtext/dialog/.content.json ... \"text\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext\" , \"name\" : \"text\" , \"label\" : \"Text\" } ... RTE defined above uses a default configuration. See the regular options available in the toolbar on the image below. It presents an application in the Rich text editor component that is a part of the Howlite library. Components development See our component development guide and documentation for dialogs to learn more on how to use input fields and define dialogs for components. RTE customization Configuration of components You can modify RTE by defining a custom configuration. Thus, let's review its structure first. RTE configuration should include entries for all functionalities available in the editor. Each entry consists of UI component details, and the plugin runs when a user clicks the UI component. See a sample configuration for Bold functionality below: { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Bold\" , \"icon\" : \"format_bold\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/bold\" } } The configuration contains a path to UI Component , its title and icon, and a path to plugin component See the result on the screen presented below. You may need to group buttons in a dropdown, for example, text alignment options. Let's assume the expected result is as follows. You can use the following configuration to implement it. { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/buttondropdown\" , \"title\" : \"Text Alignment\" , \"left\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Left Align\" , \"icon\" : \"format_align_left\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/textalign\" , \"alignment\" : \"left\" } }, \"center\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Center Align\" , \"icon\" : \"format_align_center\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/textalign\" , \"alignment\" : \"center\" } }, \"right\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Right Align\" , \"icon\" : \"format_align_right\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/textalign\" , \"alignment\" : \"right\" } }, \"justify\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Justify Align\" , \"icon\" : \"format_align_justify\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/textalign\" , \"alignment\" : \"justify\" } } } The above scenario requires embedding button components in buttondropdown . Moreover, textalign plugin requires alignment type as a parameter. Sample configuration file It is required to define a proper resource type for the RTE configuration. It should be wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/configuration . Additionally, the configuration should contain definitions for all components as described above. /apps/myapp/components/rte/configuration { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/configuration\" , \"bold\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Bold\" , \"icon\" : \"format_bold\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/bold\" } }, \"italic\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Italic\" , \"icon\" : \"format_italic\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/italic\" } }, \"underline\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Underline\" , \"icon\" : \"format_underlined\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/underline\" } }, \"strikethrough\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/ui/button\" , \"title\" : \"Strikethrough\" , \"icon\" : \"format_strikethrough\" , \"plugin\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext/plugin/strikethrough\" } } } The above configuration includes just four simple font styles. Its application results in the following RTE. Using custom configuration You can change the RTE configuration in two ways. Firstly, by adding a property with a path to a custom configuration. \"content\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext\" , \"name\" : \"content\" , \"label\" : \"Content\" , \"configuration\" : \"/apps/myapp/components/rte/configuration\" } Another option is to define the configuration explicitly under the field definition. \"content\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext\" , \"name\" : \"content\" , \"label\" : \"Content\" , \"configuration\" : { ... } } Summary Page templates may determine the overall layout of components. However, one of them can be RTE. It gives users some flexibility in the content authoring for a given area on the page. We presented how to adjust the flexibility level granted to authors. You can use a collection of plugins to customize the functionalities of RTE. Moreover, you can implement your UI or plugin components as well.

And of course the line can vary from one definition to another. In this blogpost, I would like to look into how the web has changed from web 1.0 to what it is right now and how these changes and business needs have impacted the evolution of content management systems. The evolution of WWW and its impact on content management systems The first website in history was published on August the 6th, 1991 by Tim Berners Lee. While working at CERN, Berners Lee was frustrated with the fact that there is so much knowledge spread with the thousands of researchers employed at CERN and yet\u2026 it is near impossible to access and use it. In his own words: \u201cI found myself answering the same questions asked frequently of me by different people. It would be so much easier if everyone could just read my database.\u201d It took some serious work and negotiations from the London-born physicist to convince his boss to allow him to work on the project then called \u201cInformation Management\u201d (later changed to WorldWideWeb). The website below is the key milestone of that project: The first webpage ( source ) This simple compilation of links and text started everything. Fast forward about 5 - 6 years and the WWW grew to over 200.000 websites . Nothing compared to near 2 billion we have in 2022 1 . But what was noticed then, is that producing new content with HTML authoring tools will simply not scale up to the needs. Wise observation for the time, considering that the websites of tech giants like Microsoft or IBM still looked something like this: Microsoft \u201cwrite us\u201d page in late 1996 ( source ) IBM homepage in October 1996 ( source ) All this was still in the mid of web 1.0 era, Internet Explorer had just learned to support CSS and shortly after Document Object Model was born. Pages like above shaped the early requirements of the CMS: Having one, central repository where content authors would collaborate efficiently; Easing the process of content creation by removing pure HTML creation. More consistency between pages needed; Rudimentary set of permissions for content authors, so that it is clear who can work on which parts of the website; Some basic security over our content and the information we want and potentially do not want to publish. That was really it. And early content management systems allowed for exactly that. Server side scripting transformed simple templates filled in by authors to HTML. One database stored all the content and managed permissions. Only one distribution channel - the desktop, only static pages served, and finally, only one way communication: from the content authors to the web. Things were simple. Fast forward to the Web 2.0 era. This is when users started generating content. Pages were no longer static, e-commerce had arrived and soon social media started becoming very relevant . The web users now communicate with the businesses in digital. And they expect to be heard. Around that time (2008 - 2010) your CMS should: Support WYSIWYG content authoring; Support complex, publishing workflows; Allow for bi-directional communication with your users; Store and serve various media types, including rich media. Things became much trickier - your CMS then had to support some complex processes and integrate with a lot of different applications (think about all the Wordpress app-like plugins). And this is something it was not designed to do initially. One more jump in time and we are in 2015 - 2017. 2017 was the first year when mobile traffic overtook the desktop . And it has remained so until now. The WWW users now expect a consistent experience between desktop and mobile. There are 1 billion websites in the world. Your CMS has become more of a platform that: Supports all devices; Gathers data and customer intelligence; Is context aware and serves personalized content; Supports multiple infrastructure and deployment models; Integrates seamlessly with 3rd party software. Even though monolithic CMS are still standing strong, it is becoming apparent that at some point, the amount of data, touchpoints and users will become a challenge. Scaling monoliths will be complicated or costly but most likely both. And this is actually how we enter the DXP. DXP - a revolution or \u201cjust\u201d next step? I do not like definitions, so I will not quote Gartner Glossary here. Allow me to list the challenges I think a DXP should address: The ability to deliver contextualized experiences to digital channels (web, mobile, apps, social media, email, IoT devices\u2026) and scale up quickly and at low cost . Consistency between all channels and devices for a full, end to end customer journey. There is nothing more annoying than an empty basket on your mobile app when you've just completed it on a website. One to one personalization. 75% of consumers are likely to buy from companies that are able to suggest a product based on their previous interest, buys and journeys 2 . The ability to extend your customer\u2019s profile by easily connecting other systems - CRM, CDP and similar. Using any tools you like. Due to the architecture of a DXP, you should not be subject to vendor - locking. Instead you are able to build the best digital marketing suite out of the tools and systems you feel are best. You could argue that some of the same issues we were trying to solve as early as in 2016. And I would agree. There is a major factor to consider here though, which is the volume . There is a fantastic book by Vaclav Smil called Numbers don\u2019t lie (I\u2019d recommend you give the entire book a read) and one of the chapters touches on the volume of data we produce. Some facts: In 2018 in the United States, the internet users have downloaded 97000 hours of movies and series from Netflix every minute . They watched 4.5 million Youtube movies and generally transferred a total of 3.1 petabytes of data (that is 3.1 x 10 15 bytes). Again that is every minute . In 2016, the pace in which we produced data was estimated to be 16 zettabytes a year, which is 16 * 10 21 bytes. To put that into perspective: you would have to download the 4k Braveheart movie about 400.000.000.000 times to generate the same volume. It is estimated that by 2025 this number will be ten times higher - 160 zettabytes a year (which is 160 * 10 21 bytes). Somewhere in all of this, is your digital estate and your CMS. So what is a DXP? In essence, a DXP is a technological suite, at heart of which could be the CMS. The suite should be powered by an architecture with loosely - coupled elements that allows you to easily plug in tools (personalization engines, marketing automation, CRM etc.) that improve your user and customer experience. Most importantly however, that architecture should be able to serve all your visitors, channels and data volume now, tomorrow and three years from now, when it becomes even more challenging (as indicated by Professor Smil in his book). Is DXP a revolution then? In my opinion no, it is the next step, just like Web 2.0 CMS was the next step from Web 1.0 CMS. Does it require a shift in technical design from what it initially was? Yes, definitely. DXP - should you care? Yes, you should. Here is why: Digital Experience Platform market size will be worth $15.80 Billion by 2025 3 , 4 65% of North American consumers say they trust a business less when they experience a problem using a website or mobile app 5 55% of customers prefer digital channels over traditional channels 5 32% consumers say they will walk away from a brand they love after just one bad experience 6 If a company has a digital presence and wants to keep up with user\u2019s growing expectations - a DXP should be on their radar. Summary The goal of this post is to give the reader an overview of how the needs of the businesses in WWW have shaped content management systems. We went from its early days to explaining the explosion of data and delivery channels and what challenges they have brought. In the next blogpost, I would like to introduce how our product - WebSight is designed to fit the demanding digital environment today. We will take a closer, more technical look into the features and architecture that is able to power the next generation of Customer Experience.","title":"How has CMS evolved into DXP?

All of the solutions above are mature and battle-tested, they adapt to changing world but still use best practices from previous decades. I am not the first one who noticed it. We need applications that are more secure, faster, easier to scale and at the same time cheaper to run and simpler. There are many emerging players available on the market including Jamstack-compatible solutions like Contentful, Webiny, Strapi, and so on. Single Page Applications' popularity and requirements of supporting multiple channels helped Headless CMSs to successfully enter the market. The only problem is that there is always a tradeoff. Headless solutions are often designed to solve certain problems and operate in cloud-native environments, but at the same time are lacking enterprise features (like WYSIWYG authoring, granular role-based security, and multi-site management to name a few), mostly because of simplified underlying data structure (designed for structured content), lightweight programming models, and lack of maturity. We asked ourselves if it is possible to have a solution that combines the advantages of both approaches?? Have mature, tested, and feature-rich platforms and the ability to deliver experiences at web-scale in cloud-native architectures? THE OBSERVATION Like many things in technology, we can search for analogies in real life. The beer is brewed in breweries, but later distributed to bars to make more people enjoy it in a better environment Food comes from multiple sources like farmlands or sea but is later processed and delivered to groceries or served in restaurants A movie is created in a studio, and later watched in multiple places like a cinema or at home Games are developed in studios, but people enjoy it using game consoles or PCs The critical point here is that the place where you create and develop is different from where you consume it. It\u2019s done for multiple reasons: scalability, security, performance, cost, and overall experience. THE IDEA To deliver enterprise experiences at a web scale we decided to resolve the core problem of recent platforms. When you take a look at mature CMS systems like WordPress or AEM, you\u2019ll see that publishers or renderers are almost always technological copies of authoring environments. Of course, it was a natural step, if one instance is not enough to deliver the content, you multiply it and eventually add caching layers to hide architecture limitations. But is it the way it should be? In our vision, CMS has to focus purely on the authoring experience. From the programmer's point of view, we see it as a distributed IDE for content authors. Optimized for content creation, management, and integration of multiple data sources. It should be created to provide a unified environment for preparing customer experiences. What\u2019s important - data itself may come from internal data storage (which should be designed to handle structured and unstructured data) or external sources. Examples of data sources are PIM systems, enterprise applications, or external databases. Everything has to be managed in (not served by) CMS, which plays the role of the content hub. Experiences, once created, should be delivered to the end-users via another, dedicated environment - the runtime. At the same time, we want to avoid any runtime dependencies between runtime and authoring environments. Here the push model comes to play. Runtime should be designed to serve experiences at a true web scale. No more publishers, content synchronization, dispatchers, read-only replicas, and instance multiplication. What could be the ideal place to do that? The answer is simple, the cloud. THE SOLUTION A simplified diagram presents the options we have now. We can choose mature, feature-rich enterprise solutions (on the left), which are often part of closed, proprietary ecosystems, or choose lighter cloud-native alternatives (on the right). Mature CMS\u2019es seem to not keep up with the progress, because of server-oriented architectures which were designed in the 2000s to work on physical machines in dedicated data centers. New headless systems are limited and not complete solutions. They are lacking the integration layer, and the dynamic content is orchestrated directly in the browser, which calls microservices. What if we merge two and take the best from two worlds? Well, we did it and the result is WebSight . As we already know it has two major parts: WebSight CMS - enterprise-grade authoring system created using battle-tested technologies. Apache Sling, Apache Felix, and Apache Oak are a foundation that allows us to take advantage of years of experience from other players. At the same time, we had a chance to avoid many pitfalls and use only components which are ready to work in a container-oriented world. We took the advantage of being able to create our solution from the ground. WebSight Runtime - cloud-native architecture designed to serve experiences in a secure, scalable, and performant way. Its core is cloud-agnostic, but our first implementation is based on AWS. The difference with Jamstack is that the integration and rendering layers are in the cloud, not in a browser. Serverless functions give us more flexibility and fully replace the need for publisher instances at runtime. NEXT STEPS At the time of writing this post, WebSight is a functional product. We use it internally to create the first projects and work on the first public release. We\u2019ll be sharing here the insights into the architecture and development process, so stay tuned, because there's more to come.","title":"On the road to the perfect DXP"},{"location":"blog/2022/on-the-road-to-the-perfect-dxp/#the-problem","text":"It is very easy to get lost when it comes to choosing the technology stack driving your digital projects.

However, to run the application, the software we develop is only one part. The second one is the environment (e.g., JVM and OS). In this article, I will focus on building an OSGi application and explain five benefits we gained thanks to containerizing it. Modularity In the previous article \u201c Building OSGi applications with Sling Feature Model \u201d we discussed modularity on the bundles and features (micro) level. In this article, we analyze another level - application/container. Thanks to containers, we can benefit from micro-level modularity at the application (macro) level. Containers allow us to set up a new, minimal but self-sufficient environment to run the OSGi platform. And because it is so simple, we can prepare many single-purpose, containerized applications. Container images are immutable after creation. And here comes the first tradeoff - modification of applications is no longer an option when the container run. We are not able to use OSGi bundles pluggability in full. We install all necessary bundles in the build time, but no changes or additions are later allowed in the run time. But there is good news. Instead of adding more bundles to the existing applications, we can add entirely new specialized containers and plug them into the system. This approach improves the system architecture by keeping it modular and enables the delivery of the extra piece of functionality independently. Let\u2019s take an example. When running an OSGi environment on a VM was expensive, we were tempted to pack all features into a single application to minimize the setup and management costs. Thanks to containerization we create separate, specialized applications that can combine features and deliver limited functionality. That is a massive step towards a distributed system with applications that have their life cycle and can scale up and down independently. Deployability We already know that the container is immutable. That means all applications inside the container are immutable too. Preparing a container image requires extra effort (e.g., gathering all dependencies the application needs to run). However, we might use the Sling OSGi Feature Model in the case of OSGi applications and let it handle stuff like downloading dependencies. The gain here is confidence. Once the image is ready, it will behave the same way anywhere we deploy it. Of course, there are tradeoffs here too. We will no longer be able to hot reload/install bundles and change configs manually on the production setups. (We can still do it for development purposes, to improve developer experience). The question here is: do we want to do manual changes on production anymore? Imagine having 100 containers to update. Does applying change on all the containers manually even make sense? To be fair, one thing is best practices, and another is having the possibility to do it in emergencies. Let's think about how we can deal with this tradeoff. The answer can be automation. We can implement Continuous Integration and Delivery pipelines to perform changes quickly when necessary and roll back to the previous version in a matter of minutes (which is usually much faster than manual fixes in multiple places). Portability JVM and OSGi give us some level of portability. We can run an OSGi application independently of the operating system (assuming the compatibility of the Java version etc.). Containers give us another level of portability. Once built, we can run a container on our local machine, deploy it to Kubernetes (locally, on-premise, or in the cloud), or use managed container orchestration service, like AWS ECS, and stop worrying about the infrastructure underneath. Containers enable the portability of applications between cloud providers, acting as a runtime standard. Maintainability Another advantage of containers is that they make you think of applications as stateless. Containers should be able to stop or start at any moment for no reason. Since they are self-sufficient, no manual actions are required to spawn a new instance, and no additional downloads happen (it should be done already during the build phase and embedded into the image). That means, having a closed, immutable application, we can test it once and deploy it many times. Also, performing a rollback is an easy operation. From the system\u2019s perspective, it is switching to the previous application version like using an undo shortcut. All those factors make the containerized application easier to maintain. Security Last but not least - the security. Containers give us additional control over the environment like the Operating System and version/type of the Java. Managing it via Dockerfile is considered a standard and low-effort operation nowadays. Additionally, a lot of tooling on the market helps keep containers safe, like vulnerability scanners executed during Continuous Integration. Since we have all dependencies (JARs) inside the container, we can release applications regularly with security updates. There are also other best practices. For example, distroless containers minimize the attack vector (the fewer tools installed in the container, the fewer opportunities to hack in). On the other hand, using managed cloud services to run containers in comparison to running virtual machines limits significantly the number of topics we need to worry about (like patching OS, managing firewall, etc.). Summary In this article, I went through five main system qualities that we improved significantly after switching the development and delivery of our OSGi applications to containers. Containers are no silver bullet, and there were tradeoffs we had to sort out. Yet, we were able to keep the most important benefits of developing OSGi applications like high modularisation and good developer experience. In our situation, the benefits outweighed the costs of containerizing applications.","title":"Why we decided to ship and develop the OSGi application in containers"},{"location":"blog/2022/shipping-and-developing-osgi-application-in-container/#modularity","text":"In the previous article \u201c Building OSGi applications with Sling Feature Model \u201d we discussed modularity on the bundles and features (micro) level.

On the other end, experience is delivered to the site visitors . They call the web server which pulls static HTMLs / assets / JS / CSS scripts from the experience storage and serves it immediately. Note The experience storage has no access to CMS. E.g. if there is no page in the storage, then site visitor gets 404 . The above description is called a push model and assumes that the pages are prepared for the user in advance. Note that within this architecture, it is possible to switch off the CMS part, which has no impact on delivering pages. Our CMS is a Java -based OSGi application ( WebSight CMS CE ) with a NoSQL database ( MongoDB ). WebSight CMS CE allows content management and generating static HTML pages. MongoDB database stores content and assets. Note Multiple instances of WebSight CMS CE can connect to MongoDB which supports online deployments and CMS scalability. Containers We use containers to ship WebSight CMS on multiple environments, from the developer's local computers to clouds. Read our \"Why we decided to ship and develop the OSGi application in containers\" article to understand benefits of containers in our stack. Once developers create a WebSight project from the Maven archetype , they produce the following Docker images: NGINX image (web server) with addtional project-specific configurations customized CMS image with core WebSight CE / project-specific modules and configurations Docker Compose With more than one container in the platform, we need a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, we can use the Compose YAML file model to: configure all platform components ( services ) enable communication between them handle data persistancy with volumes The following diagram presents all WebSight CMS CE containers and volumes togehter. The diagram above reflects the containers logical architecture. Docker Compose configuration specifies the following services: nginx service (experience delivery) cms service (content management and pages generation) mongo service (content database) Services use volumes to save durable data outside the container (when container is destroyed and reloaded, all data on the container is lost). We specify the following volumes: experience storage volume is shared by NGINX (read) and WebSight CMS CE (write) containers content volume keeps content and assets logs volume keeps all WebSight CMS CE application logs Environments Working with containers is a standard. With Docker, we can use the same tooling to work locally as well as deploy environments to the cloud.

Layers consist of features (see Sling Feature Model for more details) which are more high-level logical units (like site management or assets management). Layers details This section describes each layer with its responsibilities: Our platform supports multi-site management. Developers can configure site mappings (short URLs, vanity URLs) and restrictions for site components. Sites can have independent release lifecycles or be aggregated into a single container for cost savings. With the sites management feature, authors can drag & drop site components to manage web pages and control their layouts. Clients can reuse our component libraries (Howlite, Bulma) to optimise the time needed to enable site creation or create their custom ones. With OSGi pluggability and Sling Feature configurability, our platform is composed of multiple low-level modules (OSGi bundles) organized in more general functionalities called features. Despite core features such as sites and assets management, our clients can easily add custom features without modifications to the platform codebase. Moreover, plugins allow clients to extend a user interface of the core features with custom actions, panels or even dashboards. React is our first choice for building resource-oriented views. Each view is a single-page application with extension points for dynamically loaded React components. However, adding custom views with other JS Frameworks like Vue.js or Angular is as simple as adding libraries and bootstrapping the app. It is a framework for building extendable web resource-oriented platforms.

The Docker Compose CLI is fully integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) . It allows to create / manage the task definitions, tasks, services using Compose YAML configuration files. Docker Compose CLI relies on CloudFormation to manage AWS Resources. Docker allows to define the platform in declarative way. Switching between local and ECS environments is as easy as switching Docker Context (any addtional AWS configurations exists in the Docker Compose YAML file). Notice Setting up the WebSight CMS CE environment in AWS presented in this tutorial is not in the AWS Free Tier. If you run the instance according to this guide, the costs will incur (~3$/day). Prerequisites After finishing Creating and developing WebSight CMS project guide you should already have: Docker installed and running on your local machine. Java 17 (e.g. AdoptOpenJDK 17 ) and Maven installed on your local machine. To complete this tutorial, you will additionally need: AWS account with permissions for Docker Compose ECS integraion . AWS CLI set up locally with your AWS credentials. Step 1: AWS configuration Registering a new domain with Route53 . Request a public certificate using AWS Certificate Manager . Validate domain ownership for the created public certificate. Create two private image repositories : Set the CMS image Repository name to <your-project-name>-cms-ce , e.g. luna-cms-ce . Set the Nginx image Repository name to <your-project-name>-nginx-ce , e.g. luna-nginx-ce . Step 2: Project configuration In this step, we will start from the project generated in the Setup guide and update Docker and Maven configuration files. Docker For simplicity, we set remote environment configuration in the same repository as the project. Create environment/remote directory. Create environment/remote/admin_password.txt and environment/remote/mongo_password.txt files and fill them with random password (both should be single-line documents). Copy environment/local/docker-compose.yml to environment/remote .

Maven Update io.fabric8:docker-maven-plugin plugin configuration in distribution/pom.xml . Add the following buildx extension to cms and nginx images <build> sections: <buildx> <platforms> <platform> linux/amd64 </platform> <platform> linux/arm64 </platform> </platforms> </buildx> Add the following execution : <execution> <id> push-docker-image </id> <phase> package </phase> <goals> <goal> push </goal> </goals> </execution> Add <docker.skip.push>true</docker.skip.push> property to the main pom.xml . Alternatively, you can check the above configuration in WebSight Starter Distribution POM (where Maven profiles are used). Step 3: Build and deployment Log in to ECR . In the project root run mvn clean install -D docker.cms-project.name=<CMS_ECR_IMAGE_URI> -D docker.nginx.name=<NGINX_ECR_IMAGE_URI> -D docker.skip.push=false . Switch Docker context to ECS docker context use ws-ecs . From environment/remote run docker compose --project-name \"websight-in-aws\" up . It may take a couple of minutes to finish. Route your domain to Application Load Balancer (that was created by the Docker Compose in the previous step) by creating a new Hosted Zone . Step 4: Verification Check ECS Console and see if all cluster services are running. Open WebSight CMS CE admin panel on <your-domain>:8443 . Use the wsadmin as login and content of environment/remote/admin_password.txt as password. Cleaning up To stop incurring AWS costs, follow these steps: From environment/remote run docker compose --project-name \"websight-in-aws\" down . It may take a couple of minutes. Delete EFS file systems for cms_logs , mongo_repository , and site_repository volumes. Delete Route53 Hosted Zone created in Deployment step. Delete certificate created in AWS Configuration step. Delete ECR repositories created in AWS Configuration step. AWS best practices This section descirbes best practices for deploying WebSight CE DXP to AWS ECS. Logs and monitoring It is always worth configuring logs and observing basic metrics for your instance. Thanks to the Docker Compose integration with AWS ECS, the AWS CloudWatch Logs service is automatically configured for your containers . Additionally, you can monitor basic metrics thanks to the CloudWatch metrics for the Fargate launch type. Secrets Use Docker secrets for storing any sensitive data (like passwords, tokens, etc.). Docker Compose integration with AWS ECS creates a new secret in the AWS Secrets Manager for each secred defined in the compose configuration file . See the examples below. Custom CMS admin credentials WebSight CE CMS enables configuring a custom admin username and password. The default values for admin user username/password are wsadmin/wsadmin . You can configure a custom username with WS_ADMIN_USERNAME environment variable . To configure a custom password use admin.password secret. You will need secret files available at deploy time next to the compose file: admin_password.txt s33cretP@ssword and reference it in the compose configuration: docker-compose.yml service : cms : secrets : - source : admin_password target : admin.password secrets : admin_password : file : ./admin_password.txt Custom MongoDB password By default, ECS Tasks configured by the Docker Compose integration have public IP assigned.

We assume you completed the project setup guide and generated a new project from the Maven archetype. All the screens and examples presented below refer to the project prepared in the previous step. Note You don\u2019t need to read and understand all the linked content, basic concepts will be explained here. WebSight CMS is based on Apache Sling which \u201cis a framework for RESTful web-applications based on an extensible content tree\u201d\u200b\u200b and OSGi specification - \u201cJava framework specification that supports the deployment of extensible and downloadable applications known as bundles\u201d. What does this mean? The two most important things coming from the technologies WebSight CMS is based on, needed to understand this guide, are OSGi bundles and Resources. OSGi bundle OSGi bundle is a unit of modularization in OSGi specification - a bundle is comprised of Java classes and other resources, which together can provide functions to end users. Open http://localhost:8080/system/console/bundles to see all the Bundles on the WebSight CMS instance and use the filter bar at the top to filter the list. Some of the bundles are delivering the OSGi specification implementation (list filtered by org.apache.felix; Apache Felix is an implementation of the OSGi specification): Some of the bundles are delivering Apache Sling functionality (list filtered by org.apache.sling): Some of the bundles are delivering WebSight CMS functionality (list filtered by WebSight): And finally, some of the bundles are delivering the functionality of the application which was just generated from archetype (list filtered by my-artifactId which was used in example project generation at the beginning of the guide): Click on my-artifactId-backend bundle to open details. At the beginning the bundle definitions were mentioned: OSGi bundle is a unit of modularization in OSGi specification - a bundle is comprised of Java classes and other resources, which together can provide functions to end users. At the screen below it is highlighted that the my-artifactId-backend is exporting (making it available to use for other bundles) some Java packages (with use of Export-Package standard OSGi bundle header - provided by bnd-maven-plugin in pom.xml and package-info.java files in the code base) and is providing some resources (with use of Sling-Bundle-Resources bundle header handled by Bundle Resources Provider). Resources As already mentioned: WebSight CMS is based on Apache Sling which \u201cis a framework for RESTful web applications based on an extensible content tree\u201d. It is important to understand the concept of an \u201cextensible content tree\u201d. WebSight CMS Resource Browser admin tool allows browsing all Resources available on the instance. Resources are organized in the tree and every resource has a path and properties. Resources are abstractions that represent objects which might be coming from different sources. Resource Browser provides an option to select \u2018Providers\u2019 (sources of Resources available in the instance) used to display the presented Resources tree. We will focus on JCR and Bundle resources. http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/ JCR (Java Content Repository) is a database with a tree structure consisting of nodes with properties. Nodes in JCR are reflected by the JCR Resource in the Resources tree. JCR is based on Java specification and implemented by Apache Jackrabbit which is also part of Sling and WebSight CMS (check the bundles list mentioned in the previous chapter and filter by org.apache.jackrabbit to see related bundles). For technical details check the links (it is not needed for this guide, all you need to know is explained in this document): https://sling.apache.org/documentation/the-sling-engine/resources.html https://jackrabbit.apache.org/jcr/jcr-api.html https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/spec/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-1.0/ Content stored in JCR is represented by JCR Resources (provided to Resources tree by JCR Resource provider). WebSight CMS is storing JCR content in MongoDB (this is the default setup and we will not go into other options here). JCR is used for all the content created during content authoring. Every created page and every added component is represented by nodes (with properties containing data) in the JCR and Resources tree. Resources could be also provided by OSGi Bundles. From the perspective of the Resources tree and Resource abstraction, there is no difference between resources provided by bundles and JCR. However, the bundle resources are read-only so would not be suitable for authorable content but are great for providing applications. The application resources provided by bundles are available as long as the bundle is available and are not stored in JCR - application data is not mixed with content data which is great from the perspective of Blue-green deployments, CI/CD, and Separation of concerns (but we will not go into details here). For technical details check the link (it is not needed for this guide, all you need to know is explained in this document): https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/bundle-resources-extensions-bundleresource.html This is how bundle resources are provided in the generated project: and the same resource in the resource browser: http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/apps/example-project/components/hello This is how JCR resources are defined in the codebase in the content module: And in the Resources tree: http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/content/example-project/pages/homepage/jcr:content Backend Resources Generated application/backend module contains in src/main/resources folder example application resources needed to work with Pages in WebSight CMS. The resources structure starts at /apps/example-project path. This path is set in the proper OSGi bundle header to provide the information about resources delivered by the bundle. The following resources are defined: . \u2514\u2500\u2500 apps \u2514\u2500\u2500 example-project - application root \"sling:resourceType\": \"ws:Application\" \u251c\u2500\u2500 components - folder containing components \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 container - example container component \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 hello - example component \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 page - example page component \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates - templates folder \u251c\u2500\u2500 contentpage - example page template \u2514\u2500\u2500 pagesspace - example pages space template Application root should be under /apps resource and must contain property sling:resourceType\" = \"ws:Application . Folders containing components and templates must be named \u2018components\u2019 and \u2018templates\u2019 and be under the application root resource. Different relative paths could be set by providing \u2018components\u2019 or \u2018templates\u2019 properties with relative paths to components or templates folders located under the application root resource - otherwise, components and templates will not be available in the authoring UI. Pages Space template In WebSight CMS content is organized in Spaces - areas where dedicated teams can work on content. WebSight CMS allows the creation of two types of spaces Assets (Digital Assets Manager) - allows managing assets Pages - allows managing pages and assets (includes the same functionality as Assets Space and more) The content module in the project generated from the archetype contains the Pages Space instance \u2018Example project\u2019 visible in the All Spaces view. New space can be created from UI: In the second step, the Space Template needs to be selected in case of Pages Space creation. The list contains the \u2018Example Project Pages\u2019 template defined at /apps/example-project/templates/pagesspace resource. Pages Space template resource must use sling:resourceType equals ws:PagesTemplate and should provide allowedChildren property defining the list of allowed pages templates to create. Another Pages Space template could be defined in the application if needed. For example: /apps/example-project/templates/anotherpagesspace { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"ws:PagesTemplate\" , \"title\" : \"Another Example Project Pages\" , \"allowedChildren\" : [ \"/apps/example-project/templates/contentpage\" ] } To deploy the updated bundle to the running instance, use the command from the backend module folder: mvn clean install -P autoInstallBundle New Pages Space template will be available: Page template Pages spaces are for page management. To create a new page, a page template is needed. Generated backend module provides example page template resource /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage sling:resourceType property of the page template must be ws:PageTemplate. title and description properties are used in UI. allowedChildren property contains an array of page templates that can be created under pages created from this template. The content Page template allows to the creation of subpages of the same type. The /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage was listed in allowedChildren property in the Pages Space template ( /apps/example-project/templates/pagesspace ) which is templates of the Example Project space: This means that page template /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage can be created under pages root in the space: http://localhost:8080/apps/websight/index.html/content/example-project/pages (click Create Page button) In the second step page properties can be set: The dialog displayed at this step is a dialog of the component defined in the initial content of the page template ( sling:resourceType\": \"example-project/components/page ). Read more about components and dialogs in Components documentation. The initial content of the page template is defined in a resource named \u2018initial\u2019 located under the page template resource. The initial content is copied to initialize the created page and properties set via dialog are set on the copied page content. Page is a node of type ws:Page. It contains a page content sub-node named jcr:content of type ws:PageContent. The nodes located under the page content node can be modified via authoring UI. All the Page properties including properties set via page dialog are set on the page content node. This is initial content of /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage page template: This is how the content node of the newly created page looks: New page templates can be created in the application. /apps/example-project/templates/examplpage is a copy of /apps/example-project/templates/contentpage with changed title, allowedChildren /apps/example-project/templates/examplpage { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"ws:PageTemplate\" , \"title\" : \"Example Page\" , \"description\" : \"Example Project\" , \"allowedChildren\" : [ \"/apps/example-project/templates/examplpage\" ] } and initial content: { \"jcr:primaryType\" : \"ws:Page\" , \"jcr:content\" : { \"jcr:primaryType\" : \"ws:PageContent\" , \"sling:resourceType\" : \"example-project/components/page\" , \"container\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"example-project/components/container\" , \"hello\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"example-project/components/hello\" }, \"hello1\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"example-project/components/hello\" , \"helloName\" : \"Example\" } } } } To make it possible to create under pages root in the space it must be added to allowedChildren in pages space template /apps/example-project/templates/pagesspace : Deploy changes again with: mvn clean install -P autoInstallBundle The new template is available to create in pages root: Page created from this template contains defined initial content: Components Content is assembled from components - elements rendering parts of content according to implemented functionality. To understand the Components concept see the Components documentation. Generated backend module contains 3 example components located under /apps/example-project/components page - component used to render page content node container - container component - allows adding of the child components via authoring UI hello - component displaying hello text In the editor components list, only the hello component is visible because other components are hidden because of group property value. http://localhost:8080/apps/websight/index.html/content/example-project/pages/new-page::editor New components can be defined to deliver application functionality. We will add a new component named Rich Text which will allow advanced text editing. Create new folder under /apps/example-project/components named richtext with content: { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"ws:Component\" , \"title\" : \"Rich Text\" , \"description\" : \"Allows advanced text edition\" , \"group\" : \"Example Project\" } Define dialog resource: { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/dialog\" , \"richtext\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/richtext\" , \"label\" : \"Text\" , \"name\" : \"text\" } } Define rendering script richtext.html (name must be matching component resource name + .html): < data-sly data-sly-test = \"${properties.text && properties.text != '<p></p>'}\" > ${properties.text @ context='html'} </ data-sly > See Components documentation for more details. This is how the new component definition looks in the codebase. Deploy the change with the command from the backend module: mvn clean install -P autoInstallBundle The new component is available now in the editor and can be added to the page. If text is not configured via dialog, nothing is rendered because of the data-sly-test statement in the component renderer. If nothing is rendered by the component the placeholder is displayed automatically in the editor. Edit action can be used to open dialog and use rich text dialog input to configure the text. Frontend Frontend scripts and resources are provided by the frontend module - webpack project containing the application frontend. During the build, the resources are embedded into a bundle which is also deployed to the instance. The generated module contains just a simple CSS class to center the text used in the hello component. The CSS files are built into the main.css file by webpack and embedded into the OSGi bundle installed on the instance which makes the files available as resources (because of the Sling-Bundle-Resources header in the bundle header). Frontend resources are published automatically because of the WebSight-Apps-WebRoot bundle header (see next chapter about publishing). The CSS file is included in the page component renderer to load the CSS. http://localhost:8080/apps/browser#/apps/example-project/webroot/main.css Add the hello component to the page to see the centered hello text Publishing Assembled content can be previewed in the editor and published to make it available for end users. http://localhost:8080/apps/websight/index.html/content/example-project/pages/new-page::editor The published page is served by the Nginx container: http://localhost/new-page.html End-to-end tests Test module contains content used during end-to-end tests execution to validate the application.

WebSight CMS page editor lists all available components which can be used to build pages at a given WebSight instance (depending on OSGi bundles delivering components installed on the instance). Those components can be added to the page by dragging them to the page content view at the center of the screen. Components definitions listed in WebSight CMS page editor Page content structure can be checked in the page editor content tree tab. This view presents the components tree under page content. This example page for now contains just the Page Section component - this is the only component present currently in page content of this example page. Page content tree in editor The Page Section component is a container, so it allows adding other components via the authoring interface. In the page editor content section it is displayed as a box with plus icon (empty container placeholder). After drag and drop of Title and Rich Text components the page content tree is updated with new nodes. The nodes visible in the content tree are the instances of components. Title and Rich Text components are not containers so other components cannot be added as their child components. During dragging other components from components list the new items can be added just next to those components as other children on the Page Section component. After adding a component to the page, edit action can be used to edit selected component instance. The dialog which is displayed is a part of component definition. It is defined by the developer implementing a given component with use of set given dialog fields (see more in Dialogs documentation). Properties set via the dialog are saved at edited component instances and used by the component to render the part of content according to the implemented functionality - for example Title component is rendering the Heading text field value in HTML <h> tag and allows to set <h> tag level and styling.

The resources should be provided in the OSGi bundle. See the project setup documentation for more details. In this section we will see how component definition resources structure should look. Simple component definition example Let's see how simple component definition looks like. We see a component named Say Hello , providing dialog with 1 text field which can be used in the authoring interface to set the hello text rendered on page in <p> HTML tag. If the property is not set, Hello World! text will be used. My example application delivers the resource /apps/example-site/components/hello which is component definition. It contains just 3 properties: sling:resourceType = ws:Component which is making this resource the component definition title = Say Hello which is title of the component visible in authoring UI group = Example group which is a group name visible in authoring UI Example component definition in WebSight Resource Browser The component is visible in the WebSight CMS page editor and after adding to the page it renders \u2018Hello World!\u2019 text. Because the Say Hello component was added to the edited page the corresponding node was created in the page content: The Hello World! text is rendered in the view because of the hello.html resource defined under component definition resource containing the script used to render the content node. The script renders the helloText property value or Hello World! , if property value is empty (which is empty for now, so we see the fallback text). Example component renderer in WebSight Resource Browser. Second resource under the component definition is dialog resource - dialog definition resource. It contains just sling:resourceType = wcm/dialogs/dialog property which defines how the dialog should be displayed (see more details in sections below) and it has sub-node helloText defining text field ( sling:resourceType = wcm/dialogs/textfield ) input with label Hello Text . Example component dialog resources in WebSight Resource Browser. Because the dialog is defined, the edit action in editor allows to open the dialog as set value of the text field. The property value is set on the content node of this Say Hello component instance at helloText property (according to name property value at the text field node in the dialog definition): And now the component renderer script will display the property value instead of fallback text: Let\u2019s see all the options and the details of the component definition. Component definition properties Component definition is a Sling Resource with resource type ws:Component . Use following resource properties to define the component: Component property Required Value Description sling:resourceType Yes ws:Component Defines that this resource is component definition. sling:resourceSuperType No super resource type Set this property to make your component extend another component. This way the extended component elements can be reused in the extending components. Example value: \"wcm/core/components/page\" title Yes string Component name visible in UI. Example value: \u2018Title\u2019 group Yes string Component group name - allows to present related components in UI and is used during defining allowedComponents. Use value \u2018.hidden\u2019 to make the component definition not visible in the UI. Example value: \u2018General\u2019 isContainer No boolean, false by default Defines the component as a container. Containers are components dedicated to contain child components which can be added, removed and reordered with use of the authoring interface. If true then allowedComponents property is required too. allowedComponents No* array of strings, values are absolute component paths and group names. No default value - by default nothing is allowed. *required if isContainer=\u201dtrue\u201d; Array listing allowed child components absolute paths or groups that can be added to the container. Example value: [ \"/apps/my-app/components/component1\", \"/apps/my-app/components/component2\", \"Content\", \"Blog\" ] isLayout No boolean, false by default Defines the component as a layout component. Layout components are displayed in a separate section in WebSight CMS pages editor than components which are not layout components. It\u2019s up to component developer to set isLayout=true, but the guideline is to use it for components which are: - used to define page layout - must contain other components to be usable - contains no logic (other than related to layout calculation) - interacts only on page resize (no other \u201cuser actions\u201d allowed) - has no visible UI elements (like texts) Examples of Layouts: - 2 columns container - 1 column container - Section with title, image, text and CTA (container including components) Example of components which are not Layouts: - image or title or CTA - has visible UI elements (like texts) - logo cloud (contain very specific CSS logic, should not be used to create generic page layouts) - Accordion - contains logic (other than related to layout calculation) - Image gallery - contains logic (other than related to layout calculation) instanceResourceType No resource type which will be set on created component instance If this property is not set then the resource type of every created component instance node will be set to value resolved from the component definition resource path. If set, then this property value will be used instead. This allows multiple components definitions which will be resulting with the same resource type used for created component instances. It could be used to deliver components (or layout components) with different initial content. For example: \u2018Section\u2019 layout component contains embedded Title component and is a container rendering child components below the Title. If the authoring section with 4 columns needs to be created then the \u2018Section\u2019 component needs to be added and then 4 containers need to be added inside and configured to be displayed as columns. If this page layout is commonly used during content authoring then a new layout component could be implemented to simplify the process. \u2018Section with 4 columns\u2019 layout component could be added - instanceResourceType property should be set to \u2018Section\u2019 component resource type and initial content should provide the same structure as was created manually before (section + 4 configured child containers). This way after dropping \u2018Section with 4 columns\u2019 on the page the commonly used content structure would be ready to use immediately. Example value: \"my-app/components/section\" Dialog Dialog is the form with inputs which allows setting data on component instances in content. The form layout, fields and behavior are described by resources starting at a resource named dialog defined under component definition resource. If the dialog resource is not defined, then the edit component properties action is not available in editor. This is how the dialog definition structure looks and the same dialog displayed in editor: Component dialog resources structure in Resource Browser tool Component dialog displayed after edit component action in pages editor Read more in the Dialogs documentation. Rendering script To render components, the rendering script file resource is needed. File resource name should be the same as the component name with .html extension - recommended and supported scripting language in WebSight CMS is the HTL Templating Language. See the HTL specification here If Java support is needed in the HTL, the recommended solution is use of Sling Models and HTL Use-API. See details: use block statement Use-API Sling Models Component renderer script in WebSight Resource Browser. Template Component template is a resource which is getting copied during creating a new component instance added to a page - in other words, it is the initial content of the component. It is used to set default values or prepare needed content structure. Could be used also to save work during content authoring. The component template resource is a component definition sub-node with name template . The template resource is optional - if not present, a new empty node will be created.

We recommend completing the general quick start guide first to get familiar with basic concepts. The scenario utilizes a sample component library Howlite and a demo site project Luna . For simplicity, we overrode the Title component included in the Howlite collection in advance and prepared the Luna Title component inside the demo project. Your task is to update the Luna Title component and extend existing functionality and tests. See more details in the sections below. Important notice All scripts presented below are designed for Linux-based platforms. If you are a Windows user, please install and configure Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Part A: Prerequisites Install AdoptOpenJDK 17 with 'x64/aarch64' architecture (on mac use brew install openjdk@17 ): $ java --version openjdk 17.0.2 2022-01-18 OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.2+8 (build 17.0.2+8) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.2+8 (build 17.0.2+8, mixed mode) Install Node.js and NPM Install Docker Desktop . Part B: Setup local environment Clone Luna repository and build it. git clone https://github.com/websight-io/starter.git cd starter ./mvnw clean install -P e2e Run docker environment. docker compose -f environment/local/docker-compose.yml up -d Congratulations! Your local environment is ready. Open http://localhost:8080/ and log in using wsadmin / wsadmin credentials. Part C: Changing component Hint If you need help to navigate inside WebSight, see the general getting started for details. Business requirement Let's imagine the following scenario. Page owner wants to update the title of the new Grand Luxor Jewelry Collection. The ask is to keep the collection name in one line and decrease the font size for the text Meet our . The expected result is presented below. Technical scope You need to extend the Title component included in the Howlite to implement the above requirement. However, let's check the orginal component first to identify the scope of changes. Run WebSight, open Luna space and edit home page. Find the Title having text Meet our New Grand Luxor Jewelry Collection and edit its properties. Enable Overline text option, move Meet our from Heading text to Overline text and submit changes. The result is close to the expectation, but the font size of the overline text is too small. You could prepare a new version of the Title component having a different font size for the overline text. However, this is not a flexible solution. An additional input field to define the font size for the overline text is a better option. Info For simplicity, we overrode the original component in advance and prepared the Luna Title . It is a part of the demo site project, but it is just a placeholder. It works exactly as the Title . The following sections guide you on how to implement the change. Component update Your task is to enable the setting of the overline font size. Firstly, you need to add a new field overlineSize in the model class LunaTitleComponent.java . Let's define a default size hl-title__heading--size-5 according to the received design too. application/backend/src/main/java/pl/ds/luna/compoennts/models/LunaTitleComponent.java package pl.ds.luna.components.models ; import javax.inject.Inject ; import org.apache.sling.api.resource.Resource ; import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.Default ; import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.Model ; import pl.ds.howlite.components.models.TitleComponent ; @Model ( adaptables = Resource . class ) public class LunaTitleComponent extends TitleComponent { @Inject @Default ( values = { \"hl-title__heading--size-5\" }) private String overlineSize ; public String getOverlineSize (){ return overlineSize ; } } Next, you need to update the component HTML template. The original one defines the CSS class determining the font size as hl-title__heading--size-6 . < h6 class = \"hl-title__heading hl-title__heading--size-6\" data-testid = \"overline\" > ${model.subtitle} </ h6 > As you updated the model class, you can use its property now. application/backend/src/main/resources/apps/luna/components/lunatitle/lunatitle.html < h6 class = \"hl-title__heading ${model.overlineSize}\" data-testid = \"overline\" > ${model.subtitle} </ h6 > The last step is to add the field to the dialog used by authors. They need it to define component properties in the page editor. You have to override the dialog definition from Howlite. Create a new dialog directory and put .content.json file inside. application/backend/src/main/resources/apps/luna/components/lunatitle/dialog/.content.json { \"tabs\" : { \"generalTab\" : { \"container\" : { \"overlineSize\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"sling:orderBefore\" : \"overline\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" , \"include\" : { \"sling:resourceSuperType\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" , \"label\" : \"Overline size\" , \"name\" : \"overlineSize\" , \"description\" : \"Changes font size\" , \"s\" : { \"selected\" : true }, \"m\" : { \"selected\" : false } } } } } } } The above definition specifies the new overlineSize field. It is placed before overline field and uses heading size definition from Howlite, but with small size selected by default. Install changes Run the following command to install the changes on your local environment. ./mvnw -f application/backend/pom.xml clean install -P autoInstallBundle Part D: Functional tests Run functional tests We enhance WebSight CMS by adding new features, improving UX, and fixing bugs. Thus, we need confidence that implemented changes don't lead to any regression. We use Cypress for automated testing to ensure it. Moreover, this approach enables us to spend less time on manual testing and regression fixes. We can focus on developing new features and improvements as a result. We prepared two sample functional tests for the Luna Title component. They are executed during maven build. You can run them using npm on your local environment too. However, you have to add a test content before. Use the following script to install it. ./mvnw -f tests/content/pom.xml clean install -P autoInstallPackage Now, you can run the tests using the following command. npm run-script test --prefix tests/end-to-end If you execute them, they detect your changes for the Luna Title and fail. You should get the following results. Running: lunatitle.cy.ts (1 of 1) Luna Title component 1) renders correctly in preview mode 2) renders correctly in edit mode 0 passing (8s) 2 failing 1) Luna Title component renders correctly in preview mode: AssertionError: expected '<h6.hl-title__heading.hl-title__heading--size-5>' to have CSS property 'font-size' with the value '20px', but the value was '25.008px' + expected - actual -'25.008px' +'20px' ... 2) Luna Title component renders correctly in edit mode: Timed out retrying after 4000ms + expected - actual { 'sling:resourceType': 'luna/components/lunatitle', title: 'New heading', showSubtitle: 'true', - overlineSize: 'hl-title__heading--size-5', subtitle: 'New overline text', 'jcr:primaryType': 'nt:unstructured', headingLevel: 'h1', headingSize: 'hl-title__heading--size-2' } When a functional test fails, you should check why. It is expected in this case, as you implemented the new requirements. Firstly, you updated the default font size of the overline (to ensure consistency with the design). Secondly, you added a new property to the dialog for the component. The tests recognized both changes, and you should adjust them as well. The following section presents how to complete it. Hint Even better is to start by changing a test, so it fails and then adjusting the implementation so that the test passes. Update functional tests As functional tests fail due to the changes, you should adjust them. They are placed in file tests/end-to-end/tests/lunatitle.cy.ts . The first test checks the font size for the overline text. There are two component instances validated. Thus, you need to update assertions for both of them as follows. cy . getByTestId ( 'component_title1' ) . findByTestId ( 'overline' ) . should ( 'have.css' , \"font-size\" , \"25.008px\" ) . should ( 'have.text' , 'Additional overline text filled' ) cy . getByTestId ( 'component_title2' ) . findByTestId ( 'overline' ) . should ( 'have.css' , \"font-size\" , \"25.008px\" ) . should ( 'have.text' , 'Resized to 6 cols on L breakpoint' ) The second test validates the dialog for the component. Update the test to recognize the new input field. cy . request ( '/content/luna-test/pages/LunaTitle/jcr:content/rootcontainer/maincontainer/pagesection/title.json' ) . its ( 'body' ) . should ( 'deep.eq' , { 'sling:resourceType' : 'luna/components/lunatitle' , title : 'New heading' , showSubtitle : 'true' , overlineSize : 'hl-title__heading--size-5' , subtitle : 'New overline text' , 'jcr:primaryType' : 'nt:unstructured' , headingLevel : 'h1' , headingSize : 'hl-title__heading--size-2' }); Run functional tests again Now, you can execute the functional tests again. ./mvnw -f tests/content/pom.xml clean install -P autoInstallPackage npm run-script test --prefix tests/end-to-end Both tests should pass this time. You should get a report like the one below. Running: lunatitle.cy.ts (1 of 1) Luna Title component \u2713 renders correctly in preview mode (1030ms) \u2713 renders correctly in edit mode (2774ms) 2 passing (4s) Congratulations!

However, let's check the orginal component first to identify the scope of changes. Run WebSight, open Luna space and edit home page. Find the Title having text Meet our New Grand Luxor Jewelry Collection and edit its properties. Enable Overline text option, move Meet our from Heading text to Overline text and submit changes. The result is close to the expectation, but the font size of the overline text is too small. You could prepare a new version of the Title component having a different font size for the overline text. However, this is not a flexible solution. An additional input field to define the font size for the overline text is a better option. Info For simplicity, we overrode the original component in advance and prepared the Luna Title . It is a part of the demo site project, but it is just a placeholder. It works exactly as the Title . The following sections guide you on how to implement the change.","title":"Technical scope"},{"location":"docs/developers/quick-start/#component-update","text":"Your task is to enable the setting of the overline font size. Firstly, you need to add a new field overlineSize in the model class LunaTitleComponent.java . Let's define a default size hl-title__heading--size-5 according to the received design too. application/backend/src/main/java/pl/ds/luna/compoennts/models/LunaTitleComponent.java package pl.ds.luna.components.models ; import javax.inject.Inject ; import org.apache.sling.api.resource.Resource ; import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.Default ; import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.Model ; import pl.ds.howlite.components.models.TitleComponent ; @Model ( adaptables = Resource . class ) public class LunaTitleComponent extends TitleComponent { @Inject @Default ( values = { \"hl-title__heading--size-5\" }) private String overlineSize ; public String getOverlineSize (){ return overlineSize ; } } Next, you need to update the component HTML template. The original one defines the CSS class determining the font size as hl-title__heading--size-6 . < h6 class = \"hl-title__heading hl-title__heading--size-6\" data-testid = \"overline\" > ${model.subtitle} </ h6 > As you updated the model class, you can use its property now. application/backend/src/main/resources/apps/luna/components/lunatitle/lunatitle.html < h6 class = \"hl-title__heading ${model.overlineSize}\" data-testid = \"overline\" > ${model.subtitle} </ h6 > The last step is to add the field to the dialog used by authors. They need it to define component properties in the page editor. You have to override the dialog definition from Howlite. Create a new dialog directory and put .content.json file inside. application/backend/src/main/resources/apps/luna/components/lunatitle/dialog/.content.json { \"tabs\" : { \"generalTab\" : { \"container\" : { \"overlineSize\" : { \"sling:resourceType\" : \"wcm/dialogs/components/include\" , \"sling:orderBefore\" : \"overline\" , \"path\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" , \"include\" : { \"sling:resourceSuperType\" : \"/libs/howlite/components/common/headingsize\" , \"label\" : \"Overline size\" , \"name\" : \"overlineSize\" , \"description\" : \"Changes font size\" , \"s\" : { \"selected\" : true }, \"m\" : { \"selected\" : false } } } } } } } The above definition specifies the new overlineSize field.

Thus, we need confidence that implemented changes don't lead to any regression. We use Cypress for automated testing to ensure it. Moreover, this approach enables us to spend less time on manual testing and regression fixes. We can focus on developing new features and improvements as a result. We prepared two sample functional tests for the Luna Title component. They are executed during maven build. You can run them using npm on your local environment too. However, you have to add a test content before. Use the following script to install it. ./mvnw -f tests/content/pom.xml clean install -P autoInstallPackage Now, you can run the tests using the following command. npm run-script test --prefix tests/end-to-end If you execute them, they detect your changes for the Luna Title and fail.

It is expected in this case, as you implemented the new requirements. Firstly, you updated the default font size of the overline (to ensure consistency with the design). Secondly, you added a new property to the dialog for the component. The tests recognized both changes, and you should adjust them as well. The following section presents how to complete it.
